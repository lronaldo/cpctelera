## This file is intendend for you to be able to config the way in which  ##
## you would like to build CPCtelera, the compiler executables and path. ##
## The most important thing you can do is selecting the actual files and ##
## modules you want to be built, thus leaving out anything you are not   ##
## going to use. This lets you save space an enables you to have only    ## 
## the code that will be actually executed.                              ##

## SECTION 1: COMPILER CONFIGURATION

##  Setting assembler flags for compilation of CPCTelera library
##

Z80ASMFLAGS=-l -o -s

####
## SECTION 2: LIBRARY CONFIG
##
## This section establishes source and object subfolders and the binary objects to
## be built. Normally, you want to change the OBJ files you want to be built, selecting
## only the ones that contain the actual code that will be used by you in your application.
##
## SRCDIR       >> Directory under which assembly source files are located
## OBJDIR       >> Directory where generated intermediate object files will be written to
## SUBDIRS      >> All first level subdirectories found in $(SRCDIR)/. They are assumed to contain code files.
## OBJSUBDIRS   >> Subdirectory structure for object files that replicates SUBDIRS
## SRCFILES     >> All .s files to be found under $(SRCDIR)/ and first level SUBDIRS, with full relative path
## OBJFILES     >> intermediate .rel files that will be needed for your application (their names
##                 have to correspond to existing source files in the SRCDIR, but with .rel extension)
