.module cpct_keyboard

;;
;; Function: cpct_scanKeyboard_if
;;
;;    Reads the status of keyboard and joysticks and stores it in the 
;; 10 bytes reserved as <cpct_keyboardStatusBuffer>. This function is ~25% faster
;; than standard <cpct_scanKeyboard>. (Interrupt-Unsafe version)
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_scanKeyboard_if> ()
;;
;; Output results (10 bytes):
;;    <cpct_keyboardStatusBuffer> filled up with pressed / not pressed info
;; about all the 80 available Amstrad CPC's keys / buttons.
;;
;; Assembly call:
;;    > call cpct_scanKeyboard_if_asm
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;    * This function may not work properly if an interrupt occurs during the
;; execution of this code. You should use this function always in interrupt-safe 
;; places (inside an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), for instance)
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function does the same as <cpct_scanKeyboard> but using an unrolled
;; loop to gain 42 microseconds (~25% performance increase, with a cost of 57 bytes
;; more in memory requirements for code, ~116% increase).
;;
;;    This function reads the pressed / not pressed status of the entire set
;; of 80 keys / buttons from the Amstrad CPC and writes this status in 
;; <cpct_keyboardStatusBuffer>. <cpct_keyboardStatusBuffer> is a 10-bytes 
;; buffer (80 bits) that holds 1 bit for each key / button of the Amstrad CPC,
;; meaning 0 = pressed, and 1 = not pressed. This codification is the same
;; as the one returned by the AY-3-8912 chip, which reads the keyboard when
;; Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) chip demands it. For more details
;; on how all this process works, check <Keyboard> topic.
;;
;;    The function does not disable nor reenable interrupts (contrary to what
;; <cpct_scanKeyboard_f> does). This means that this function is Interrupt-Unsafe.
;; If an interrupt happens during the execution of this function's code, the 
;; output may be corrupt. To prevent this from happening, you should ensure that
;; this function is called only in interrupt-safe places. You may call in a 
;; syncronized part of your code, knowing that no interrupt will happen there, 
;; inside a manually disabled interrupts section, or inside an interrupt service
;; routine. In any case, is up to you to ensure that no interrupt happens during
;; key scanning.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    104 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;; Case | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles

;;    This fragment of code is based on a <scanKeyboard code issued by CPCWiki at
;; http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Programming:Keyboard_scanning>. This version
;; of the code is, however, ~60% faster than CPCWiki's.
