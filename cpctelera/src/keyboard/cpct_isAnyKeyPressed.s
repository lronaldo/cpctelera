.module cpct_keyboard

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_isAnyKeyPressed
;;
;;    Checks if there is at least one key pressed.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    <u8> <cpct_isAnyKeyPressed> ();
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_isAnyKeyPressed_asm
;;
;; Return value:
;;    <u8> - *false* (0, no single key is pressed) or *true* (>0, at least one key
;; is pressed). Take into account that *true* is not 1, but any non-0 number. Return 
;; value is placed in registers A and L (same value for both)
;;
;; Details:
;;    Checks if at least one key from the keyboard is pressed. It does it looking   
;; at the <cpct_keyboardStatusBuffer>, which is an 80-bit array holding the pressed / not pressed 
;; status of each of the 80 keys in the CPC keyboard. If at least one key is pressed, 
;; one of the 80-bits representing the keys must be set to 0 (which means that key
;; is pressed right now).
;;
;;    The <cpct_keyboardStatusBuffer> is just an array in memory that *must
;; be updated* with current key status. To do this, <cpct_scanKeyboard> 
;; routines *must be* used before calling this function.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    A, B, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;       13 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;;   Case      | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles 
;; -------------------------------------------
;; Any         |       83       |    332
