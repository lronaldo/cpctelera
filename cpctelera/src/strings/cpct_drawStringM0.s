;;
;; Function: cpct_drawStringM0
;;
;;    Prints a null-terminated string with ROM characters on a given byte-aligned 
;; position on the screen in Mode 0 (160x200 px, 16 colours).
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawStringM0> (void* *string*, void* *video_memory*, <u8> *fg_pen*, <u8> *bg_pen*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (5 Bytes):
;;  (2B HL) string       - Pointer to the null terminated string being drawn
;;  (2B DE) video_memory - Video memory location where the string will be drawn
;;  (1B C ) fg_pen       - Foreground colour (PEN, 0-15)
;;  (1B B ) bg_pen       - Background colour (PEN, 0-15)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawStringM0_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *string* must be a null terminated string. It could contain any 8-bit value as 
;; characters except 0, which will signal the end of the string. Be careful to provide
;; strings with a 0 (null) at the end of the string. Otherwise, unexpected results may
;; happen (Typically, rubbish characters printed on screen and, occasionally, memory 
;; overwrite and even hangs or crashes).
;;  * *video_memory* could theoretically be any 16-bit memory location. It will work
;; outside current screen memory boundaries, which is useful if you use any kind of
;; double buffer. However, be careful where you use it, as it does no kind of check
;; or clipping, and it could overwrite data if you select a wrong place to draw.
;;  * *fg_pen* must be in the range [0-15]. It is used to access a colour mask table and,
;; so, a value greater than 15 will return a random colour mask giving unpredictable 
;; results (typically bad character rendering, with odd colour bars).
;;  * *bg_pen* must be in the range [0-15], with identical reasons to *fg_pen*.
;;
;; Requirements and limitations:
;;  * *Do not put this function's code below 0x4000 in memory*. In order to read
;; characters from ROM, this function enables Lower ROM (which is located 0x0000-0x3FFF),
;; so CPU would read code from ROM instead of RAM in first bank, effectively shadowing
;; this piece of code. This would lead to undefined results (typically program would
;; hang or crash).
;;  * This routine does not check for boundaries. If you draw too long strings or out 
;; of the screen, unpredictable results will happen.
;;  * Screen must be configured in Mode 0 (160x200 px, 16 colours)
;;  * This function requires the CPC *firmware* to be *DISABLED*. Otherwise, random
;; crashes might happen due to side effects.
;;  * This function *disables interrupts* during main loop (character printing), and
;; re-enables them at the end.
;;  * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function receives a null-terminated string and draws it to the screen in 
;; Mode 0 (160x200, 16 colours). This function calls <cpct_drawCharM0> to draw every    
;; character. *video_memory* parameter points to the byte where the string will be
;; drawn. The first pixel of that byte will be the upper-left corner of the string.
;; As this function uses a byte-pointer to refer to the upper-left corner of the 
;; string, it can only draw string on even-pixel columns (0, 2, 4, 6...), as 
;; every byte contains 2 pixels in Mode 0.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    189 bytes (36 bytes this function, 153 bytes <cpct_drawCharM0>)
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;;   Case     |    Cycles    |   microSecs (us)
;; ----------------------------------------------
;;   Best     | 185 + 3774*L | 46.25 +  956.00*L
;;   Worst    | 185 + 4454*L | 46.25 + 1126.00*L
;; ----------------------------------------------
;; Asm saving |        -84   |          -21.00
;; ----------------------------------------------
;; (end code)
;;    L = Length of the string (excluding null-terminator character)
;;
;; These time measures take into account the time it takes to draw each individual
;; character (call to <cpct_drawCharM0>, assembly entry point).
