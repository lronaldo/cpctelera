;;
;; Function: cpct_drawCharM2
;;
;;    Prints a ROM character on a given byte-aligned position on the screen 
;; in Mode 2 (640x200 px, 2 colours).
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawCharM2> (void* *video_memory*, <u8> *pen*, <u8> *ascii*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 Bytes):
;;  (2B DE) video_memory - Video memory location where the character will be drawn
;;  (1B C ) pen          - Colour configuration (!=0 Normal / =0 Inverted)
;;  (1B B ) ascii        - Character to be printed (ASCII code)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawCharM2_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *video_memory* could theoretically be any 16-bit memory location. It will work
;; outside current screen memory boundaries, which is useful if you use any kind of
;; double buffer. However, be careful where you use it, as it does no kind of check
;; or clipping, and it could overwrite data if you select a wrong place to draw.
;;  * *pen* 0 = Inverted, >0 = Normal. Normal means foreground colour = PEN 1, 
;; background colour = PEN 0. Inverted means the contrary of normal. 
;;  * *ascii* could be any 8-bit value, as 256 characters are available in ROM.
;;
;; Requirements and limitations:
;;  * *Do not put this function's code below 0x4000 in memory*. In order to read
;; characters from ROM, this function enables Lower ROM (which is located 0x0000-0x3FFF),
;; so CPU would read code from ROM instead of RAM in first bank, effectively shadowing
;; this piece of code. This would lead to undefined results (typically program would
;; hang or crash).
;;  * Screen must be configured in Mode 2 (640x200 px, 2 colours)
;;  * This function requires the CPC *firmware* to be *DISABLED*. Otherwise, random
;; crashes might happen due to side effects.
;;  * This function *disables interrupts* during main loop (character printing), and
;; re-enables them at the end.
;;  * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function reads a character from ROM and draws it at a given byte-aligned 
;; video memory location, that corresponds to the upper-left corner of the 
;; character. As this function assumes screen is configured for Mode 2
;; (640x200, 2 colours), it means that the character can only be drawn at module-8 
;; pixel columns (0, 8, 16, 24...), because each byte contains 8 pixels in Mode 2.
;; It can print the character in 2 different colour configurations:
;;  Normal   - PEN 1 over PEN 0 (*pen* > 0)
;;  Inverted - PEN 0 over PEN 1 (*pen* = 0)
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    76 bytes
