;; Function: cpct_drawCharM0
;;
;;    Prints a ROM character on a given even-pixel position (byte-aligned) on the 
;; screen in Mode 0 (160x200 px, 16 colours).
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawCharM0> (void* *video_memory*, <u8> *fg_pen*, <u8> *bg_pen*, <u8> *ascii*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (5 Bytes):
;;  (2B DE) video_memory - Video memory location where the character will be drawn
;;  (1B C )  fg_pen       - Foreground palette colour index (Similar to BASIC's PEN, 0-15)
;;  (1B B )  bg_pen       - Background palette colour index (PEN, 0-15)
;;  (1B A )  ascii        - Character to be drawn (ASCII code)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawCharM0_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *video_memory* could theoretically be any 16-bit memory location. It will work
;; outside current screen memory boundaries, which is useful if you use any kind of
;; double buffer. However, be careful where you use it, as it does no kind of check
;; or clipping, and it could overwrite data if you select a wrong place to draw.
;;  * *fg_pen* must be in the range [0-15]. It is used to access a colour mask table and,
;; so, a value greater than 15 will return a random colour mask giving unpredictable 
;; results (typically bad character rendering, with odd colour bars).
;;  * *bg_pen* must be in the range [0-15], with identical reasons to *fg_pen*.
;;  * *ascii* could be any 8-bit value, as 256 characters are available in ROM.
;;
;; Requirements and limitations:
;;  * *Do not put this function's code below 0x4000 in memory*. In order to read
;; characters from ROM, this function enables Lower ROM (which is located 0x0000-0x3FFF),
;; so CPU would read code from ROM instead of RAM in first bank, effectively shadowing
;; this piece of code. This would lead to undefined results (typically program would
;; hang or crash).
;;  * Screen must be configured in Mode 0 (160x200 px, 16 colours)
;;  * This function requires the CPC *firmware* to be *DISABLED*. Otherwise, random
;; crashes might happen due to side effects.
;;  * This function *disables interrupts* during main loop (character printing), and
;; re-enables them at the end.
;;  * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function reads a character from ROM and draws it at a given byte-aligned 
;; video memory location, that corresponds to the upper-left corner of the 
;; character. As this function assumes screen is configured for Mode 0
;; (160x200, 16 colours), it means that the character can only be drawn at even 
;; pixel columns (0, 2, 4, 8...), because each byte contains 2 pixels in Mode 0.
;; It prints the character in 2 colours (PENs) one for foreground (*fg_pen*), and 
;; the other for background (*bg_pen*). 
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    157 bytes (16 bytes conversion table, 141 bytes code)
;;
;; Time Measures:
