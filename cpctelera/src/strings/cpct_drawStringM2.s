;;
;; Function: cpct_drawStringM2
;;
;;    Prints a null-terminated string with ROM characters on a given byte-aligned 
;; position on the screen in Mode 2 (640x200 px, 2 colours).
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawStringM2> (void* *string*, void* *video_memory*, <u8> *pen*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 Bytes):
;;  (2B HL) string       - Pointer to the null terminated string being drawn
;;  (2B DE) video_memory - Video memory location where the string will be drawn
;;  (1B C ) pen          - Colour configuration (!=0 Normal / =0 Inverted)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawStringM2_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *string* must be a null-terminated string. It could contain any 8-bit value 
;; as characters except 0, which will signal the end of the string. Be careful 
;; to provide strings with a 0 (null) at the end of the string. Otherwise, 
;; unexpected results may happen (Typically, rubbish characters printed on screen 
;; and, occasionally, memory overwrite and even hangs or crashes).
;;  * *video_memory* could theoretically be any 16-bit memory location. It will work
;; outside current screen memory boundaries, which is useful if you use any kind of
;; double buffer. However, be careful where you use it, as it does no kind of check
;; or clipping, and it could overwrite data if you select a wrong place to draw.
;;  * *pen* 0 = Inverted, >0 = Normal. Normal means foreground colour = PEN 1, 
;; background colour = PEN 0. Inverted means the contrary of normal. 
;;
;; Requirements and limitations:
;;  * *Do not put this function's code below 0x4000 in memory*. In order to read
;; characters from ROM, this function enables Lower ROM (which is located 0x0000-0x3FFF),
;; so CPU would read code from ROM instead of RAM in first bank, effectively shadowing
;; this piece of code. This would lead to undefined results (typically program would
;; hang or crash).
;;  * This routine does not check for boundaries. If you draw too long strings or out 
;; of the screen, unpredictable results will happen.
;;  * Screen must be configured in Mode 2 (640x200 px, 2 colours)
;;  * This function requires the CPC *firmware* to be *DISABLED*. Otherwise, random
;; crashes might happen due to side effects.
;;  * This function *disables interrupts* during main loop (character printing), and
;; re-enables them at the end.
;;  * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function receives a null-terminated string and draws it to the screen in 
;; Mode 2 (640x200, 2 colours). This function calls <cpct_drawCharM2> to draw every    
;; character. *video_memory* parameter points to the byte where the string will be
;; drawn. The first pixel of that byte will be the upper-left corner of the string.
;; As this function uses a byte-pointer to refer to the upper-left corner of the 
;; string, it can only draw string on module-8-pixel columns (0, 8, 16, 24...), as 
;; every byte contains 8 pixels in Mode 2.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    109 bytes (33 bytes this function, 76 bytes <cpct_drawCharM2>)
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;;   Case     |   Cycles    |   microSecs (us)
;; -------------------------------------------
;;   Best     | 143 + 799*L | 28.75 + 199.75*L 
;;   Worst    | 143 + 843*L | 28.75 + 210.75*L
;; ----------------------------------------------
;; Asm saving |       -84   |         -21.00
;; ----------------------------------------------
;; (end code)
;;    L = Length of the string (excluding null-terminator character)
;;
;; These time measures take into account the time it takes to draw each individual
;; character (call to <cpct_drawCharM2>, assembly entry point).
