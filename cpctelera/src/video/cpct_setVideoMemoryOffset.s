;;
;; Function: cpct_setVideoMemoryOffset
;;
;;    Sets the 8 Least Significant bits (the offset) of the memory address where
;; video memory starts.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_setVideoMemoryOffset> (<u8> *offset*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 bytes):
;;    (1B L) offset - New starting offset for Video Memory (8 Least Significant bits)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_setVideoMemoryOffset_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;    * *offset* could be any 8-bit value, and should contain video memory 
;; offset value. Its 8-bits will become the 8 Least Significant bits (LSb) of
;; the programmable Video Memory Start Address (VMSA), as the 2 least significant 
;; bits of the address are always set to 0 (see figure 1). For instance, an
;; *offset* value of 10101011 will set the VMSA to xxxxxx1010101100, being
;; xxxxxx the previous value of VMSA page. Consult <cpct_setVideoMemoryPage>
;; for more details on this.
;;
;; Details:
;;    Changes part of the address where video memory starts (Video Memory Start
;; Address, VMSA). Video memory starts at an address that can be defined in 
;; binary as follows:
;; (start code)
;;  --------------------------------------------------------
;;             VMSA = [ ppppppoooooooo00 ]
;;  --------------------------------------------------------
;;  Figure 1 - Video Memory Start Address (VMSA) composition
;; (end)
;;    where you have 6 bits that define the Page (p-bits), and 8 bits that 
;; define the *offset* (o-bits). The 2 Least Significant Bits (LSb) are always
;; set to 0.
;;
;;    This function changes the 8 bits that define the *offset* (the o-bits). 
;; These 8 bits are controlled by Register R13 from the CRTC. If you wanted
;; to change the 6 Most Significant bits (the page), you should use
;; <cpct_setVideoMemoryPage>
;;                                                                 
;;    Changing the *offset* effectively changes the place where your video 
;; memory starts in your system RAM, immediately changing what is displayed 
;; on screen. This could be used to produce scrolling effects or to make 
;; a fine grained control of double / triple buffers by hardware.
;;                                                                  
;;    To better explain this, lets show an example,
;;
;;    1 - You want your VMSA at 0xC0A0, instead of 0xC000
;;    2 - 0xC0A0 corresponds to page = 0x30, offset = 0xA0 (check Figure 1)
;;    3 - Page 0x30 is set by default (memory address starts at 0xC000 at power on)
;;    4 - You only have to call cpct_setVideoMemoryOffset(0xA0)
;; 
;;    Another example, requiring page and offset to be set, could be the next
;; one. Imagine you have a double buffer starting at memory address 0x801A and
;; you wanted to make it visible on screen. Your code to do that could be like
;; this:
;; (start code)
;;    ...
;;    cpct_setVideoMemoryPage(cpct_page80);  // Set page   0x80
;;    cpct_setVideoMemoryOffset(0x1A);       // Set offset 0x1A
;;    ...
;; (end)
;;    When creating hardware back buffers, always take into account that video
;; memory is never considered linear by Gate Array. This means that, wherever 
;; you put your VMSA, it will be considered the start of a Video Memory made 
;; of 8-pixel-line characters. Consult <cpct_drawSprite> for more details on
;; how video memory is distributed at its default place (it will be distributed
;; similarly at every place it were located).
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    F, BC, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    9 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;;    Case    | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles
;; -----------------------------------------
;;     Any    |     15         |    60
;; -----------------------------------------
;; (end code)
