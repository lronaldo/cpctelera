;; Function: cpct_getScreenPtr
;;
;;    Returns a byte-pointer to a screen memory location, given its X, Y coordinates.
;; (in *bytes*, NOT in pixels!)
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    <u8>* <cpct_getScreenPtr> (void* *screen_start*, <u8> *x*, <u8> *y*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 Bytes):
;;    (2B DE) screen_start - Pointer to the start of the screen (or a backbuffer)
;;    (1B C ) x            - [0-79]  Byte-aligned column starting from 0 (x coordinate, 
;;    (1B B ) y            - [0-199] row starting from 0 (y coordinate)
;; *in bytes*)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_getScreenPtr_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;    * *screen_start* will normally be the start of the video memory where you want to 
;; draw something. However, you may give a pointer to the start of a screen backbuffer
;; located everywhere in memory.
;;    * *x* must be in the range [0-79]. Screen is always 80 bytes wide (unless you
;; change CRTC registers), and this function is byte-aligned, so you have to give it
;; a byte coordinate (*NOT a pixel one!*). 
;;    * *y* must be in the range [0-199]. Screen is always 200 pixels high (again, 
;; unless you change CRTC registers). Pixels and bytes always coincide in vertical
;; resolution, so this coordinate is the same in bytes that in pixels.
;;    * If you give incorrect values to this function, the returned pointer could
;; point anywhere in memory. This function will not cause any damage by itself, 
;; but you may destroy important parts of your memory if you use its result to 
;; write to memory, and you gave incorrect parameters by mistake. Take always
;; care.
;;
;; Return Value:
;;    (HL) u8* - Pointer to the (*x*,*y*) byte in the screen memory that starts 
;; at *screen_start*.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;    * This function only works for default screens (80 bytes wide, 200 pixel
;; lines, 25 characters of 8 pixel lines). If you change screen configuration
;; by modifying CRTC registers, this function may not work for you.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function returns a pointer to the byte whose screen coordinates
;; are (*x*, *y*) in *bytes*, being *screen_start* the screen origin (0, 0) or,
;; what is the same, a pointer to the first byte of the screen. The "screen"
;; may be the actual screen or a backbuffer with same layout.
;;
;;    What this function exactly does is this calculation,
;;    > return screen_start + 80 * ((int)(y / 8)) + 2048 * (y % 8) + x
;;
;;    This calculation is based on the default layout of the screen, which is
;; 80 bytes wide (80 bytes per pixel line) and 200 pixel lines high. Pixel
;; lines are grouped into 25 groups of 8 pixel lines, as it is explained in
;; <cpct_drawSprite>. Each group of 8 pixel lines starts 0x50 bytes away 
;; from the previous one (0x50 = 80, hence the term [80 * ((int)(y / 8))]) and
;; the each lines inside a group is separated by 0x800 bytes from its
;; predecessor (0x800 = 2048, and we have the other term [2048 * (y % 8)]). 
;;
;;    All the previous paragraph explains how much we have to displace from
;; *screen_start* to arrive to the start of the *y* pixel line. Once we are
;; there, the byte *x* is just *x* bytes away, so we only have to add *x*
;; to the formula, and we are done.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values:
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    C-bindints - 32 bytes
;;  ASM-bindints - 28 bytes
;;
