;;
;; Function: cpct_drawSprite
;;
;;    Copies a sprite from an array to video memory (or to a screen buffer).
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawSprite> (void* *sprite*, void* *memory*, <u8> *width*, <u8> *height*) __z88dk_callee;
;;
;; Input Parameters (6 bytes):
;;  (2B HL) sprite - Source Sprite Pointer (array with pixel data)
;;  (2B DE) memory - Destination video memory pointer
;;  (1B C ) width  - Sprite Width in *bytes* [1-63] (Beware, *not* in pixels!)
;;  (1B B ) height - Sprite Height in bytes (>0)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawSprite_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *sprite* must be an array containing sprite's pixels data in screen pixel format.
;; Sprite must be rectangular and all bytes in the array must be consecutive pixels, 
;; starting from top-left corner and going left-to-right, top-to-bottom down to the
;; bottom-right corner. Total amount of bytes in pixel array should be *width* x *height*.
;; You may check screen pixel format for mode 0 (<cpct_px2byteM0>) and mode 1 
;; (<cpct_px2byteM1>) as for mode 2 is linear (1 bit = 1 pixel).
;;  * *memory* could be any place in memory, inside or outside current video memory. It
;; will be equally treated as video memory (taking into account CPC's video memory 
;; disposition). This lets you copy sprites to software or hardware backbuffers, and
;; not only video memory.
;;  * *width* must be the width of the sprite *in bytes*, and must be in the range [1-63].
;; A sprite width outside the range [1-63] will probably make the program hang or crash, 
;; due to the optimization technique used. Always remember that the width must be 
;; expressed in bytes and *not* in pixels. The correspondence is:
;;    mode 0      - 1 byte = 2 pixels
;;    modes 1 / 3 - 1 byte = 4 pixels
;;    mode 2      - 1 byte = 8 pixels
;;  * *height* must be the height of the sprite in bytes, and must be greater than 0. 
;; There is no practical upper limit to this value. Height of a sprite in
;; bytes and pixels is the same value, as bytes only group consecutive pixels in
;; the horizontal space.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;     * This function does not do any kind of boundary check or clipping. If you 
;; try to draw sprites on the frontier of your video memory or screen buffer 
;; if might potentially overwrite memory locations beyond boundaries. This 
;; could cause your program to behave erratically, hang or crash. Always 
;; take the necessary steps to guarantee that you are drawing inside screen
;; or buffer boundaries.
;;     * As this function receives a byte-pointer to memory, it can only 
;; draw byte-sized and byte-aligned sprites. This means that the box cannot
;; start on non-byte aligned pixels (like odd-pixels, for instance) and 
;; their sizes must be a multiple of a byte (2 in mode 0, 4 in mode 1 and
;; 8 in mode 2).
;;     * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function copies a generic WxH bytes sprite from memory to a 
;; video-memory location (either present video-memory or software / hardware  
;; backbuffer). The original sprite must be stored as an array (i.e. with 
;; all of its pixels stored as consecutive bytes in memory). It only works 
;; for solid, rectangular sprites, with 1-63 bytes width
;;
;;    This function will just copy bytes, not taking care of colours or 
;; transparencies. If you wanted to copy a sprite without erasing the background
;; just check for masked sprites and <cpct_drawMaskedSprite>.
;;
;;    Copying a sprite to video memory is a complex operation due to the 
;; particular distribution of screen pixels in CPC's video memory. At power on,
;; video memory starts at address 0xC000 (it can be changed by BASIC's scroll,
;; or using functions <cpct_setVideoMemoryPage> and <cpct_setVideoMemoryOffset>).
;; This means that the byte at 0xC000 contains first pixels colour values, the ones
;; at the top-left corner of the screen (2 first pixels in mode 0, 4 in mode 1 and 
;; 8 in mode 2). Byte at 0xC001 contains next pixel values to the right, etc. 
;; However, this configuration is not always linear. First 80 bytes encode the 
;; first screen pixel line (line 0), next 80 bytes encode pixel line 8, next 
;; 80 encode pixel line 16, and so on. Pixel line 1 start right next to pixel
;; line 200 (the last one on screen), then goes pixel line 9, and so on. 
;; 
;; This particular distribution was thought to be used in 'characters' when it 
;; was conceived. As a character has 8x8 pixels, pixel lines have a distribution
;; in jumps of 8. This means that the screen has 25 character lines, each one
;; with 8 pixel lines. This distribution is shown at table 1, depicting memory 
;; locations where every pixel line starts, related to their character lines.
