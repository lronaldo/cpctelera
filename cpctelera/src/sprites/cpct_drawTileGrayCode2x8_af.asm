.module cpct_sprites

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_drawTileGrayCode2x8_af
;;
;;    Copies a 2x8-byte sprite to video memory (or screen buffer), assuming that
;; the sprite lines are grey-code ordered and the location to be copied is Pixel 
;; Line 0 of a character line.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawTileGrayCode2x8_af> (void* *pvideomem*, void* *sprite*) __z88dk_callee;
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 bytes):
;;  (2B HL) sprite end - Pointer to the end of the sprite array (Sprite in Gray Code format)
;;  (2B DE) pvideomem  - Pointer (aligned) to the first byte in video memory where the sprite will be copied.
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawTileGrayCode2x8_af_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;    * *sprite* must be a pointer to the last byte of an array containing sprite's
;; pixels data in screen pixel format, and in graycode line order. Sprite must be 
;; rectangular. Total amount of bytes in pixel array should be *16*. You may 
;; check screen pixel format for mode 0 (<cpct_px2byteM0>) and mode 1 
;; (<cpct_px2byteM1>) as for mode 2 is linear (1 bit = 1 pixel). Line order
;; will be 0-1-3-2-6-7-5-4, meaning that the first 2 bytes will contain the
;; pixel values for screen line 0 and last 2 bytes pixel values for screen line 4.
;; For clarity, if we consider the 16 bytes of the sprite, their order in the 
;; given array must be: 
;;      > BYTE: [0,1,2,3,6,7,4,5,12,13,14,15,10,11,8,9]
;;      >        --- --- --- --- ----- ----- ----- ---
;;      > LINE:   0   1   3   2    6     7     5    4
;;    * *memory* must be a pointer to the first byte in video memory (or screen
;; buffer) where the sprite will be drawn. This location *must be aligned*, 
;; meaning that it must be a Pixel Line 0 of a screen character line. To Know
;; more about pixel lines and character lines on screen, take a look at
;; <cpct_drawSprite>. If *memory* points to a not aligned byte (one pertaining
;; to a Non-0 Pixel Line of a character line), this function will overwrite 
;; random parts of the memory, with unexpected results (typically, bad drawing 
;; results, erratic program behaviour, hangs and crashes).
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;     * This function does not do any kind of boundary check or clipping. If you 
;; try to draw sprites on the frontier of your video memory or screen buffer 
;; if might potentially overwrite memory locations beyond boundaries. This 
;; could cause your program to behave erratically, hang or crash. Always 
;; take the necessary steps to guarantee that you are drawing inside screen
;; or buffer boundaries.
;;     * As this function receives a byte-pointer to memory, it can only 
;; draw byte-sized and byte-aligned sprites. This means that the sprite cannot
;; start on non-byte aligned pixels (like odd-pixels, for instance) and 
;; their sizes must be a multiple of a byte (2 in mode 0, 4 in mode 1 and
;; 8 in mode 2).
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function does the same as <cpct_drawTileAligned2x8_f>, but using
;; a Gray Code Line Order for the screen lines (0-1-3-2-6-7-5-4), and 
;; getting bytes from memory in pairs, using POP instruction. 
;;
;;    Copies a 2x8-byte sprite from an array with 16 screen pixel format 
;; bytes, and Grey Code Line Order (0-1-3-2-6-7-5-4) to video memory or a 
;; screen buffer. This function is tagged *aligned*, meaning that the 
;; destination byte must be *character aligned*. Being character aligned 
;; means that the 8 lines of the sprite will coincide with the 8 lines of 
;; a character line in video memory (or in the screen buffer). For more 
;; details about video memory character and pixel lines check table 1 at 
;; <cpct_drawSprite>.
;;
;;    As the 8 lines of the sprite must go to a character line on video 
;; memory (or screen buffer), *memory* destination pointer must point to
;; a the first line (Pixel Line 0) of a character line. If hardware 
;; scrolling has not been used, all pixel lines 0 are contained inside
;; one of these 4 ranges:
;;
;;    [ 0xC000 -- 0xC7FF ] - RAM Bank 3 (Default Video Memory Bank)
;;    [ 0x8000 -- 0x87FF ] - RAM Bank 2
;;    [ 0x4000 -- 0x47FF ] - RAM Bank 1
;;    [ 0x0000 -- 0x07FF ] - RAM Bank 0
;;
;;    All of them have 3 bits in common: bits 5, 4 and 3 are always 0 
;; (--000---). Any address not having all these 3 bits set to 0 does not
;; refer to a Pixel Line 0 and is not considered to be aligned.
;;
;;    This function will just copy bytes, not taking care of colours or 
;; transparencies. If you wanted to copy a sprite without erasing the background
;; just check for masked sprites and <cpct_drawMaskedSprite>.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    HL, DE, F
;;
;; Interrupts:
;;    * Disables interrupts when called.
;;    * Enables interrupts before returning.
;;    * Uses SP register and POP to read from memory.
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    C-bindings - 61 bytes
;;  ASM-bindings - 58 bytes

;; Time Measures:
