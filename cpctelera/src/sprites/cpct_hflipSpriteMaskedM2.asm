;;
;; Function: cpct_hflipSpriteMaskedM2
;;
;;   Horizontally flips a sprite, encoded in screen pixel format, *mode 2*,  with 
;; interlaced mask.
;;
;; C definition:
;;   void <cpct_hflipSpriteMaskedM2> (<u8> width, <u8> height, void* sprite) __z88dk_callee;
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 bytes):
;;  (1B  C) width  - Width of the sprite in *bytes* (*NOT* in pixels!). Must be >= 1.
;;  (1B  B) height - Height of the sprite in pixels / bytes (both are the same). Must be >= 1.
;;  (2B HL) sprite - Pointer to the sprite array (first byte of consecutive sprite data)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_hflipSpriteMaskedM2_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *sprite* must be an array containing sprite's pixels data in screen pixel format
;; with interlaced mask data (Pairs of bytes, 1st: mask data for next byte, 2nd:
;; mode 1 pixel data byte). You may check screen pixel format for mode 2 (1 bit per pixel).
;; Each mask byte will contain enabled bits as those that should be picked from the background
;;  (transparent) and disabled bits for those that will be printed from sprite colour data. 
;; Each mask data byte must precede its associated colour data byte. Sprite must be rectangular 
;; and all bytes in the array must be consecutive pixels, starting from top-left corner 
;; and going left-to-right, top-to-bottom down to the bottom-right corner. Total amount 
;; of bytes in pixel array should be 2 x *width* x *height*. 
;;  * *width* must be the width of the sprite *in bytes*, without accounting for mask bytes, 
;;  and *must be 1 or more*. Using 0 as *width* parameter for this function could potentially 
;; make the program hang or crash. Always remember that the *width* must be expressed in bytes
;; and *NOT* in pixels. The correspondence is 1 byte = 8 pixels (mode 2)
;;  * *height* must be the height of the sprite in pixels / bytes (both should be the
;; same amount), and must be greater than 0. There is no practical upper limit to this value,
;; but giving a height greater than the height of the sprite will yield undefined behaviour,
;; as bytes after the sprite array might result modified. 
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;  * This function will admit any 16-bits value as *sprite* pointer and will *modify* 
;; bytes at the given address. On giving an incorrect address this function will yield 
;; undefined behaviour, probably making your program crash or doing odd things due to 
;; part of the memory being altered by this function.
;;  * This function does not do any kind of boundary check. If you give it 
;; incorrect values for *width*, *height* or *sprite* pointer it might 
;; potentially alter the contents of memory locations beyond *sprite* boundaries. 
;; This could cause your program to behave erratically, hang or crash. Always 
;; take the necessary steps to guarantee that your values are correct.
;;  * As this function receives a byte-pointer to memory, it can only 
;; flip byte-sized and byte-aligned sprites. This means that the box cannot
;; start on non-byte aligned pixels (like odd-pixels, for instance) and 
;; their sizes must be a multiple of a byte.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function performs an horizontal flipping of the given *sprite* along with its
;; interlaced mask. To do so, the function inverts the order of the pairs of bytes formed
;; by each mask byte and its associated pixel-definition byte, for all sprite rows. It also 
;; inverts pixel order inside each byte of the *sprite* (be it pixel byte or mask byte). 
;; The function expects to receive an *sprite* in screen pixel format (mode 2), along with
;; its interlaced mask like in this example:
;;
;; (start code)
;;    // Example call. Sprite has 16x4 pixels (2x4 bytes)
;;    cpct_hflipSpriteMaskedM2(2, 4, sprite);
;;
;;    // Operation performed by the call and results (mM, nN: mask bits)
;;    //

;;    //  |                Received as parameter               |
;;    // -------------------------------------------------------
;;    //  | sprite => [mMmMmMmM][01235678][mMmMmMmM][HGFEDCBA] |
;;    //  |           [nNnNnNnN][98765432][nNnNnNnN][abcdefgh] |
;;    //  |           [mMmMmMmM][01235678][mMmMmMmM][HGFEDCBA] |
;;    //  |           [nNnNnNnN][98765432][nNnNnNnN][abcdefgh] |
;;    // -------------------------------------------------------
;;    //  |               Result after flipping                |
;;    // -------------------------------------------------------
;;    //  | sprite => [MmMmMmMm][ABCDEFGH][MmMmMmMm][87653210] |
;;    //  |           [NnNnNnNn][hgfedcba][NnNnNnNn][23456789] |
;;    //  |           [MmMmMmMm][ABCDEFGH][MmMmMmMm][87653210] |
;;    //  |           [NnNnNnNn][hgfedcba][NnNnNnNn][23456789] |
;;    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;    //  Sprite takes 16 consecutive bytes in memory (4 rows with 4 bytes, 2 mask bytes
;;    //  and 2 pixel definition bytes, 8 pixels each pixel byte, for a total of 
;;    //  16x4 = 64 pixels)
;;    //
;; (end code)
;;
;;    As can be seen on the example, the function modifies the bytes of the *sprite* in-place.
;; Therefore, the *sprite* becomes horizontally flipped after the call and will not return to 
;; normal status unless another horizontally flipping operation is performed.
;;
;;    This function performs reasonably well compared to <cpct_hflipSpriteM2>, as time required
;; for doing the flip is a little bit more than doubled, for double amount of bytes. However, 
;; for maximum performance, functions making use of memory-aligned conversion tables are advised.
;; Also, having memory-aligned sprites will permit developing even faster versions. In any case,
;; The most important advantage of this function is its reduced size, compared to requiring a
;; function and a 256-bytes aligned table together.
;;
;; Use example:
;;    Next example shows a function designed to draw an animated flag
;; that flips right-to-left as if it was being agitated. To do so, every
;; 30 times it is redrawn, it is flipped horizontally to simulate that 
;; right-to-left animated movement: 
;; (start code)
;;    // Draws an animated flag that changes from left-to-right periodically 
;;    //(every 30 times it is redrawn). Flag is 24x16 mode 2 pixels 
;;    //(3x16 bytes, 6x16 bytes taking interlaced mask into account)
;;    void drawFlag(u8 x, u8 y) {
;;       static u8 timesdrawn;  // Statically count the number of times the flag has been drawn
;;       u8* pvmem;             // Pointer to video memory to draw the sprite
;;
;;       // Count for a new redraw of the flag and check if it has been
;;       // drawn 30 or more times in order to flip it
;;       if(++timesdrawn > 30) {
;;          // Horizontally flip the flag to animate it
;;          cpct_hflipSpriteMaskedM2(3, 16, flagSprite);
;;          timesdrawn = 0;
;;       }
;;
;;       // Draw the flag
;;       pvmem = cpct_getScreenPtr(CPCT_VMEM_START, x, y);
;;       cpct_drawSpriteMasked(flagSprite, pvmem, 3, 16);
;;    }

   ;; We need HL to point to the byte previous to the start of the sprite array.
   ;; This is because HL will point to the previous byte of the next row in the

   ;; (sprite width) to point to the centre of next row.

;;    Iterates throw all the rows of the sprite

;;    This external loop starts with HL and DE pointing to the central byte/s of the row

;; the row and HL to the last one, so HL points to the previous byte of the next row.
;; It reverses each byte's pair of colours, and it also reverses byte order inside the 
;; same row. So, virtual layout scheme is as follows:
