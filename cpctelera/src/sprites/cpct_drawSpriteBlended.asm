;; Function: cpct_drawSpriteBlended
;;
;;    Draws sprites blending them with current contents of screen video memory.
;; It uses XOR by default, but many other blending modes are available.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawSpriteBlended> (void* *memory*, <u8> *height*, <u8> *width*, void* *sprite*) __z88dk_callee;
;;
;; Input Parameters (6 bytes):
;;  (2B DE) memory - Destination video memory pointer
;;  (1B C ) height - Sprite Height in bytes (>0)
;;  (1B B ) width  - Sprite Width in *bytes* (>0) (Beware, *not* in pixels!)
;;  (2B HL) sprite - Source Sprite Pointer (array with pixel data)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawSpriteBlended_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *sprite* must be an array containing sprite's pixels data in screen pixel format
;; Sprite must be rectangular and all bytes in the array must be consecutive pixels, 
;; starting from top-left corner and going left-to-right, top-to-bottom down to the
;; bottom-right corner. Total amount of bytes in pixel array should be *width* x *height*
;; You may check screen pixel format for mode 0 (<cpct_px2byteM0>) and mode 1 (<cpct_px2byteM1>)
;; as for mode 2 is linear (1 bit = 1 pixel).
;;  * *height* must be the height of the sprite in bytes, and must be greater than 0. 
;; There is no practical upper limit to this value. Height of a sprite in
;; bytes and pixels is the same value, as bytes only group consecutive pixels in
;; the horizontal space.
;;  * *width* must be the width of the sprite *in bytes* and must be 1 or more. 
;; Using 0 as *width* parameter for this function could potentially make the program 
;; hang or crash. Always remember that the *width* must be expressed in bytes 
;; and *not* in pixels. The correspondence is:
;;    mode 0      - 1 byte = 2 pixels
;;    modes 1 / 3 - 1 byte = 4 pixels
;;    mode 2      - 1 byte = 8 pixels
;;  * *memory* could be any place in memory, inside or outside current video memory. It
;; will be equally treated as video memory (taking into account CPC's video memory 
;; layout). This lets you copy sprites to software or hardware backbuffers, and
;; not only video memory.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;  * This function could be used from ROM, but it will only perform a XOR
;; blending operation. Blending operation will not be possible to change 
;; on ROM, as it requires to change a byte of the code. That can only be
;; performed when this function is on RAM.
;;  * This function does not do any kind of boundary check or clipping. If you 
;; try to draw sprites on the frontier of your video memory or screen buffer 
;; if might potentially overwrite memory locations beyond boundaries. This 
;; could cause your program to behave erratically, hang or crash. Always 
;; take the necessary steps to guarantee that you are drawing inside screen
;; or buffer boundaries.
;;  * As this function receives a byte-pointer to memory, it can only 
;; draw byte-sized and byte-aligned sprites. This means that the box cannot
;; start on non-byte aligned pixels (like odd-pixels, for instance) and 
;; their sizes must be a multiple of a byte (2 in mode 0, 4 in mode 1 and
;; 8 in mode 2).
;;
;; Blending modes:
;;    This function performs, *by default, a XOR* blending operation. However,
;; This function can perform many blending operations. Consult all available
;; blending modes at <CPCT_BlendMode> documentation.
;;
;;    Standard modes included: XOR (default), OR, AND, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBC, LDI and NOT.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function blends a generic WxH bytes sprite from memory to a 
;; video-memory location (either present video-memory or software / hardware  
;; backbuffer). It performs similar to <cpct_drawSprite> but instead
;; of copying bytes and overwrite video-memory, it blends them with
;; present contents of video-memory destination (background).
;;
;;    The process is as follows. The function gets 1 byte from the destination
;; video-memory and 1 byte from the sprite. It then performs a blending 
;; operation between both bytes and stores the result in the same place where
;; it got the byte from video memory. The process is repeated for every byte
;; from the sprite.
;;
;;    The blending operation that this function performs is selectable. By 
;; default, this operation will be a XOR between both bytes. To select a
;; different operation mode, the function <cpct_setBlendMode>
;; should be called. 
;;
;; Use examples:
;;    This function may be used directly to draw a sprite in video-memory:
;; (start code)
;;    // This function will draw the sprite of the main Character
;;    void drawCharacterSprite(u8 x, u8 y) {
;;       // First, calculate video-memory location of the (x,y)
;;       // coordinates where the character is located
;;       u8 *pmem = cpct_getScreenPtr(CPCT_VMEM_START, x, y);
;;
;;       // Then, draw the sprite, blending it with the background
;;       cpct_drawSpriteBlended(pmem, 24, 8, sprite);
;;    }
;; (end code)
;;    Previous function *drawCharacterSprite* could also be used to erase
;; the sprite, leaving video-memory as it was before drawing the sprite, 
;; if the selected blending mode is XOR. Calling the function again with
;; same coordinates will do the trick, as M XOR S XOR S = M (Doing a double
;; XOR operation to any (M)emory byte against any (S)prite byte will leave
;; M untouched).
;;
;;    This function could even be used as a normal drawSprite function without
;; *width* limits (as <cpct_drawSprite> cannot draw sprites wider than 63 bytes).
;; This can be performed using the LDI mode:
;; (start code)
;;    // Draw the user interface of the application, that is composed
;;    // of several sprites 
;;    void drawUserInterface() {
;;       // First, select LDI as blending mode for cpct_drawSpriteBlended
;;       cpct_setBlendMode(CPCT_BLEND_LDI);
;;
;;       // Now print all sprites of the UI at their pre-calculated locations
;;       // Note: assume *LOCATION macros are just absolute video-memory addresses
;;       cpct_drawSpriteBlended(                 VMEM, 80, 200, background);
;;       cpct_drawSpriteBlended(  SCOREBOARD_LOCATION, 80,  20, score_board);
;;       cpct_drawSpriteBlended( LEFT_COLUMN_LOCATION, 10, 100, left_column);
;;       cpct_drawSpriteBlended(RIGHT_COLUMN_LOCATION, 10, 100, right_column);
;;    }
;; (end code)

;;    AF, BC, DE, HL

;;    C-bindings - 43 bytes
;;  ASM-bindings - 39 bytes
