.module cpct_sprites

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_drawSolidBox
;;
;;    Fills up a rectangle in video memory (or screen buffer) with a given 
;; colour data byte. Could be used for drawing coloured rectangles as well as
;; erasing screen rectangles easily.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_drawSolidBox> (void* *memory*, <u8> *colour_pattern*, <u8> *width*, <u8> *height*);
;;
;; Input Parameters (5 bytes):
;;  (2B DE) memory         - Video memory pointer to the upper left box corner byte
;;  (1B A ) colour_pattern - 1-byte colour pattern (in screen pixel format) to fill the box with
;;  (1B C ) width          - Box width *in bytes* [1-64] (Beware! *not* in pixels!)
;;  (1B B ) height         - Box height in bytes (>0)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_drawSolidBox_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *memory* could be any place in memory, inside or outside current video memory. It
;; will be equally treated as video memory (taking into account CPC's video memory 
;; disposition). This lets you copy sprites to software or hardware backbuffers, and
;; not only video memory.
;;  * *colour_pattern* could be any 8-bit value, and should be in screen pixel format.
;; Functions <cpct_px2byteM0> and <cpct_px2byteM1> could be used to calculate 
;; screen pixel formatted bytes out of firmware colours for each pixel in the byte. 
;; If you wanted to know more about screen pixel formats, check <cpct_px2byteM0> or 
;; <cpct_px2byteM1>. Screen pixel format for Mode 2 is just a linear 1-pixel = 1-bit.
;;  * *width* must be the width of the box *in bytes*, and must be in the range [1-64].
;; A box *width* outside the range [1-64] will probably make the program hang or crash, 
;; due to the optimization technique used. Always remember that the *width* must be 
;; expressed in bytes and *not* in pixels. The correspondence is:
;;    mode 0      - 1 byte = 2 pixels
;;    modes 1 / 3 - 1 byte = 4 pixels
;;    mode 2      - 1 byte = 8 pixels
;;  * *height* must be the height of the box in bytes, and must be greater than 0. 
;; There is no practical upper limit to this value. Height of a box in
;; bytes and pixels is the same value, as bytes only group consecutive pixels in
;; the horizontal space.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;    * This function does not do any kind of boundary check or clipping. If you 
;; try to draw boxes on the frontier of your video memory or screen buffer 
;; if might potentially overwrite memory locations beyond boundaries. This 
;; could cause your program to behave erratically, hang or crash. Always 
;; take the necessary steps to guarantee that you are drawing inside screen
;; or buffer boundaries.
;;    * As this function receives a byte-pointer to memory, it can only 
;; draw byte-sized and byte-aligned boxes. This means that the box cannot
;; start on non-byte aligned pixels (like odd-pixels, for instance) and 
;; their sizes must be a multiple of a byte (2 in mode 0, 4 in mode 1 and
;; 8 in mode 2).
;;    * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function draws a solid colour-patterned box (a rectangle full
;; of a given colour pattern) anywhere at the video memory or screen buffer.
;; It does so by copying the colour pattern byte to the top-left byte 
;; of the box and then cloning that byte to the next bytes of the box.
;; As it does so using an unrolled LDIR and a dynamic JR, it is limited 
;; to 64 LDIs (64 bytes-wide at most). 
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    C-bindings - 184 bytes
;;  ASM-bindings - 172 bytes
