;;
;; Function: cpct_disableFirmware
;;
;;    Disables Amstrad CPC firmware, preventing it from being executed at every
;; CPU interrupt. 
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    u16 <cpct_disableFirmware> ()
;;
;; Assembly call:
;;    > call cpct_disableFirmware_asm
;;
;; Return value:
;;    <u16> - Pointer to present interrupt handler (normally, pointer to firmware ROM code).
;; This value should be stored to restore it later, if required.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function is exactly the same as <cpct_removeInterruptHandler>, as firmware
;; is executed as an interrupt handler, and disabling them is nothing more than removing
;; it. For more details on how it works, see <cpct_removeInterruptHandler>
;;
;;    Disabling the firmware is useful for several reasons:
;;    - Firmware code gets executed 6 times per frame (1 at each interrupt) when 
;; is active. If you turn it off, you win CPU clock cycles for your program, 
;; because firmware will not execute anymore.
;;    - Most of CPCtelera's functions talk directly to hardware, no to firmware.
;; They are faster, but they do not change firmware variables. As a result, 
;; firmware can revert changes made by CPCtelera's functions when active. For 
;; instance, if you change to video mode 0 using CPCtelera's functions, firmware
;; will see that the video mode is different from what it should be (attending 
;; to its own variables) and will change it again to 1. This happens with video
;; modes and palette values mainly.
;;    - Also, firmware uses part of the RAM to store its variables (from 
;; 0xA6FC to 0xBFFF). If you accidentaly overwrite anything there with firmware
;; being active, unpredictable things will happen, even hanging the computer.
;; Moreover, disabling firmware lets you use this part of the RAM for your 
;; own uses.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    16 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;; Case | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles
;; --------------------------------------
;; Any  |      22        |     88
;; --------------------------------------

;;
;; Function: cpct_removeInterruptHandler
;;
;;    Sets nothing as interrupt handler (returns every time it is called). It
;; returns previous interrupt handler for restoration purposes.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    u16 <cpct_removeInterruptHandler> ()
;;
;; Assembly call:
;;    > call cpct_removeInterruptHandler_asm
;;
;; Return value:
;;   (u16, HL) - Previous interrupt code pointer located at 0x0039.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function sets Interrupt Mode to 1 (call 0x0038 every time a maskable 
;; interrupt happens) and then writes assembly instructions EI : RET at 0x0038.
;; (0xC9FB --> 0xFB = EI, 0xC9 = RET). This makes the CPU directly return every 
;; time an interrupt creates a jump to 0x0038 (6 times per frame, 300 times per 
;; second).
;;
;;    This function retrieves previous interrupt handler before setting it. This
;; previous interrupt handler is returned. You may store it as a 16-bits value
;; and use it again to restore it later on if you wanted.
;;
;;    Modifying the interrupt vector, this function also disables firmware, as
;; firmware will not be called again. Firmware routines are executed as a interrupt
;; handler and the ROM entry point is stored at 0x0039 (a 16-bit address where the 
;; firmware code starts). 
;;
;;    Before inserting 0xC9FB at 0x0038, the 2 bytes lying at 0x0039 are saved 
;; into DE. These 2 bytes are returned to the caller, to let them be stored and 
;; restored later on, if normal firmware operation (or previous interrupt handler) 
;; is required again. <cpct_reenableFirmware> may be used for this restoring 
;; operation.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    HL

;; Required memory:
;;    16 bytes
