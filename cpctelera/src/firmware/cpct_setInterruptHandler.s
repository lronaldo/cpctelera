;;
;; Function: cpct_setInterruptHandler
;;
;;    Sets a user provided function as new interrupt handler.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_setInterruptHandler> ( void (*intHandler)(void) )
;;
;; Input Parameters (2 Bytes):
;;   (2B HL) intHandler - A pointer to the function that will handle interrupts from now on
;; 
;; Assembly call:
;;    > call cpct_setInterruptHandler_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *intHandler* (HL) can theoretically be any 16-bit value. However, it must point to 
;; the start of a function that will be called at each interrupt. If it points to somewhere else, 
;; undefined behaviour will happen. Most probably, the program will crash as random code will 
;; be executed (that placed at the provided address). User defined function (*intHandler*)
;; must not return any value nor accept any parameters.
;;
;; Details:
;;    It modifies the interrupt vector to establish a new interrupt handler that calls
;; user provided function. The user must provide a pointer to the function (*intHandler*) 
;; that will handle interrupts. This function does not call *intHandler* or check it
;; in any way. It just sets it for being called at the next interrupts. Provided *intHandler*
;; function must not return any value nor accept any parameter. 
;;
;;    This function creates wrapper code to safely call user provided *intHandler*. This
;; code saves registers on the stack (AF, BC, DE, HL and IX) and restores them after 
;; user code from *intHandler* finishes. Therefore, user does not have to worry about
;; saving registers. However, *be very careful if you modify the alternate set of 
;; registers* (AF', BC', DE', HL') as they will not be saved by default. User is 
;; responsible for saving and restoring the values on the alternate register set
;; whenever they are modified. Otherwise, behaviour is undefined when returning from 
;; the function.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    A, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    40 bytes (17 bytes function + 23 bytes for safe interrupt wrapper code)
;;
;; Time Measures:
;;  * This first measure is the time required for cpct_setInterruptHandler to 
;; execute: that is, the time for setting up the hook for the system to call
;; user defined code.
;; (start code)
;; Case | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles
;; -------------------------------------
;; Any  |      23        |    92 
;; -------------------------------------
;; (end code)
;;  * This second measure is the time overhead required for safely calling 
;; user defined function. That is, time required by the wrapper code to save
;; registers, call user's *intHandler*, restoring the registers and returning.
;; This overhead is to be assumed each time interrupt handler is called, so 
;; up to 6 times per frame, 300 times per second.
;; (start code)
;; Case      | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles
;; ------------------------------------------
;; Overhead  |      58        |    184
;; ------------------------------------------
;; (end code)
