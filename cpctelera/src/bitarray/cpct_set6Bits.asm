.module cpct_bitarray

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_set6Bits
;;
;;    Sets the value of a selected element of 6 bits into a bitarray to [0-63].
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    <u8> <cpct_set6Bits> (void* *array*, <u16> *value*, <u16> *index*);
;;
;; Input Parameters (6 Bytes):
;;    (2B DE) array - Pointer to the first byte of the array
;;    (2B BC) value - New value [0-63] for the element of 6 bits at the given position. If 
;; you call from assembly, you can safely ignore B register and set only C register.
;;    (2B HL) index - Index of the group of 6 bits in the array to be modified
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_set6Bits_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;    * *array* must be the memory location of the first byte of the array.
;; However, this function will accept any given 16-value, without performing
;; any check. So, be warned that giving mistaken values to this function will
;; produce unexpected behaviour (it may change random bits from memory).
;;    * *value* new value for the selected 6-bits element [0-63]. Be sure not to
;; use values greater than 63 or lower than 0. Wrong values can potentially
;; change random bits from values near the selected one.
;;    * *index* position of the 6-bits element to be set in the array, 
;; starting in 0. As this function does not perform any boundary check, if you gave
;; an index outside the boundaries of the array, this function will overwrite a
;; random location in memory, yielding unexpected results.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;    * Maximum of 65536 elements of 6-bits, 49152 bytes per *array*.      
;;
;; Details:
;;    Set the new *value* of the 6-bits element at the given position (*index*) in the 
;; specified *array*. This function calculates the location in memory considering each 
;; value to take 6-bits in memory. Then, the 6 Least Significant Bits of *value* are 
;; inserted. However, take into account that values greater than 63 or lower than 0 
;; (that is, requiring more than 6 bits) could potentially modify bits from nearby 
;; elements on insertion.   
;; 
;; Examples:
;; (start code)
;;    u8 i;
;;
;;    // Declare and initialize a 6-bit Array using some useful macros
;;    const CPCT_6BITARRAY(my_array, 8) = { 
;;       CPCT_ENCODE6BITS(10, 12, 31, 45),
;;       CPCT_ENCODE6BITS( 7, 60, 18,  2)
;;    };
;; 
;;    // Multiply elements lower than 10 by 2
;;    for(i=0; i < 8; i++) {
;;       u8 value = cpct_get6Bits(my_array, i);
;;       cpct_set6Bits(my_array, value*2, i);
;;    }
;;
;;    // Show all the values. This should print: 10 12 31 45 14 60 18 4
;;    //
;;    for(i=0; i < 8; i++) {
;;       printf("%d ", cpct_get6Bits(my_array, i));
;;    }   
;; (end code)
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    C-bindings   - 94 bytes 
;;    ASM-bindings - 89 bytes

   ;; We first divide INDEX / 4 because each 4 values are stored in groups of
   ;; 3-bytes. Therefore, this lets us count how many groups of 3-bytes do we

   ;; The remainder of the division tells us which one of the 4 values contained
   ;; in that target 3-byte group, contains the target value.
