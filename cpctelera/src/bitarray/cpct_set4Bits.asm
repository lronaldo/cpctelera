.module cpct_bitarray

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_set4Bits
;;
;;    Sets the value of a selected group of 4 bits (nibble) into a bitarray to [0-15]
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_set4Bits>  (void* *array*, <u16> *value*, <u16> *index*)
;;
;; Input Parameters (6 Bytes, B register ignored, only C register is used for value):
;;    (2B DE) array - Pointer to the first byte of the array
;;    (2B HL) index - Position of the group of 4 bits in the array to be modified
;;    (2B BC) value - New value [0-15] for the group of 4 bits at the given position. If 
;; you call from assembly, you can safely ignore B register and set only C register.
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_set4Bits_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;    * *array* must be the memory location of the first byte of the array.
;; However, this function will accept any given 16-value, without performing
;; any check. Giving and incorrect *array* pointer will have unpredictable
;; results: a random nibble from your memory may result changed.
;;    * *value* new value for the selected nibble [0-15]. Only the 4 Least 
;; Significant Bits (LSBs) are used. This means that any given *value* 
;; will "work": *value* module 16 will be finally inserted in the *array*
;; position (*index*).
;;    * *index* position of the group of 4 bits (nibble) to be modified in 
;; the array, starting in 0. Again, as this function does not perform any 
;; boundary check, if you gave an index outside the boundaries of the array,
;; a nibble outside the array will be changed in memory, what will have 
;; unpredictable results.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;    * Maximum of 65536 bits, 32768 bytes per array.
;;
;; Details:
;;    Set the new *value* of the 4-bits group (nibble) at the given position 
;; (*index*) in the specified *array*. This function assumes that the *array* 
;; elements have a size of 8 bits and also that the given *index* is not bigger
;; than the number of nibbles in the *array* (size of the *array* multiplied
;; by 2). The *value* to be set is also assumed to be in the range [0-15] but 
;; other values will "work" (just the 4 Least Significant Bits will be used, 
;; so *value* module 16 will be inserted).
;; 
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;     C-bindings - 28 bytes 
;;   ASM-bindings - 24 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
