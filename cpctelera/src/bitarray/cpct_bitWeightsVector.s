.module cpct_bitarray

;;
;; Array: cpct_bitWeights
;;
;;    Internal array that contains 8 byte-values, each one with 7 bits off and 1 bit on.
;; Each value is designed to be used as a mask for getting one bit from other byte using 
;; an AND operation. Hence, the name bitWeights. It is used by <cpct_getBit> and 
;; <cpct_setBit> functions. mainly.
;;
cpct_bitWeights:: .db #0x80, #0x40, #0x20, #0x10, #0x08, #0x04, #0x02, #0x01

;; This shuould be 8-byte aligned for better performance, but compiler is not able to do it
;; .bndry 8 ;; Make this vector start at a 8-byte aligned address to be able to use 8-bit arithmetic with pointers
;; bndry does not work when generated object file is linked later on.
