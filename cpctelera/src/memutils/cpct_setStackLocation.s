;;
;; Function: cpct_setStackLocation
;;
;;    Sets a new location for the program stack in memory.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_setStackLocation> (void* *memory*) __z88dk_fastcall;
;;
;; Input Parameters (2 Bytes):
;;  (2B HL) memory - Pointer to the new location in memory where stack will be placed.
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    call cpct_setStackLocation_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *memory* has no restiction. You may place stack whereever you wanted, but you
;; should be cautious: contents of the stack could erase data, code or essential 
;; system information. If that happens, your program may crash. Have special care 
;; with system rst vector (0x0000-0x003F) and firmware memory (if enabled).
;;
;; Important notes:
;;  * This function only changes program stack to a new location by modifying the
;; stack pointer (SP). It does not take care of present contents of the stack. If
;; you want to preserve present contents of the stack, copy them to the new location
;; (you may use <cpct_memcpy>).
;;
;;  * Take into account that local variables and return addresses are usually stored
;; at the stack. When moving the stack, ensure that you copy all of its contents
;; to the new location if you want to preserve them. Otherwise, you may experience
;; unexpected behaviour.
;;
;;  * This function requires FIRMWARE to be DISABLED. Firmware may restore previous
;; location of the stack, yielding unexpected behaviour (typically, program crashes).
;;
;; Details:
;;    Changes the location of the program stack by moving the stack pointer (SP) to 
;; a new *memory* location. Changing the program stack location is useful to have
;; greater control of it and to enable the 3rd memory bank (0x8000-0xBFFF) as double buffer 
;; zone, data storage or code memory.
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    DE, HL, SP
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    4 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
;; (start code)
;;   Case     | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles
;; -----------------------------------------
;;   Any      |       7        |    28
;; -----------------------------------------
;; (end code)
;;  * This function is identical called from C or from ASM
