.module cpct_memutils

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_memset
;;
;;    Fills up a complete byte-array in memory with a given 8-bit value (as std memset)
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_memset> (void* *array*, <u8> *value*, <u16> *size*);
;;
;; Input Parameters (5 Bytes):
;;  (2B DE) array - Pointer to the first byte of the array to be filled up (starting point in memory)
;;  (1B A ) value - 8-bit value to be set
;;  (2B BC) size  - Number of bytes to be set (>= 2)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_memset_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *array* could theoretically be any 16-bit memory location. However, take into 
;; account that this function does no check at all, and you could mistakenly overwrite 
;; important parts of your program, the screen, the firmware... Use it with care.
;;  * *size* must be greater than 1. It represents the size of the array, or the number 
;; of total bytes that will be set to the *value*. As this function starts moving 1 
;; first byte and then cloning it, the minimum amount *size* should be 2. Beware! 
;; *Sizes 0 and 1* can cause this to *overwrite the entire memory*. 
;;  * *value* could be any 8-bit value, without restrictions.
;;
;; Details:
;;    Sets all the bytes of an *array* in memory to the same given *value*. This is the
;; same operation as std memset, from the standard C library does. However, this function
;; is much faster than std C memset, so it is recommended for your productions. The 
;; technique this function uses to be so faster is as follows:
;;
;;  1 - Sets up the first byte of the *array* to the *value*
;;  2 - Makes HL point to the first byte and DE to the second
;;  3 - BC has the total bytes to copy minus 1 (the first already set)
;;  4 - LDIR copies first byte into second, then second into third...
;;
;;    This function works for array sizes from 2 to 65535 (it does not work for 0 or 1).
;; However, it is recommended that you use it for values greater than 2. Depending on
;; your code, using memset for values in the range [2-8] could underperform simple
;; variable assignments. 
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    C-binding   - 14 bytes
;;    ASM-binding -  8 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures: 
;; (start code)
;;   Case     | microSecs (us) | CPU Cycles |
;; ------------------------------------------
;;   Any      |   28 + 6*S     | 112 + 24*S |
;; ------------------------------------------
;; Asm saving |     -18        |    -72     |
;; ------------------------------------------
;; (end code)
;;    S = *size* (Number of total bytes to set)
