.module cpct_memutils

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Function: cpct_memset_f8
;;
;;    Fills up a complete array in memory setting bytes 2-by-2, in chuncks of 
;; 8 bytes. Size of the array must be multiple of 8.
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    void <cpct_memset_f8> (void* *array*, <u16> *value*, <u16> *size*);
;;
;; Warning:
;;    * This function disables interrupts while operating and uses the stack
;; pointer. Take it into account when you require interrupts or the stack
;; pointer. When in doubt, use <cpct_memset> instead.
;;    * At the end of the function, it reenables interrupts, no matter how
;; they were before. Please, take into account.
;;
;; Input Parameters (5 Bytes):
;;  (2B HL) array - Pointer to the first byte of the array to be filled up (starting point in memory)
;;  (2B DE) value - 16-bit value to be set (Pair of bytes)
;;  (2B BC) size  - Number of bytes to be set (>= 8, multiple of 8)
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_memset_f8_asm
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;  * *array* could theoretically be any 16-bit memory location. However, take into 
;; account that this function does no check at all, and you could mistakenly overwrite 
;; important parts of your program, the screen, the firmware... Use it with care.
;;  * *size* must be greater than 7 and multiple of 8. It represents the size of the 
;; array, or the number of total bytes that will be set to the *value*. This function 
;; sets bytes 2-by-2, in chuncks of 8 bytes, so the minimum amount of bytes to be set is 8. 
;; *Beware!* sizes below 8 can cause this function to *overwrite the entire memory*. 
;;  * *value* could be any 16-bit value, without restrictions. It is considered as 
;; a pair of bytes that will be copied to every 2-bytes in the array.
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;  * This function *will not work from ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;
;; Details:
;;    Sets all pairs of bytes of an *array* in memory to the same given *value*. This is 
;; the same operation as std memset from standard C library, but with the added advantage
;; of being faster and letting the user define the contents 16-bits-by-16-bits instead of
;; 8. The technique used by this function is as follows:
;;
;;  1 - It saves the value of SP to recover it at the end of the function
;;  2 - It places SP at the last 2-bytes of the array
;;  3 - It uses PUSH instructions to set bytes 2-by-2, in chuncks of 8 bytes, until the entire array is set
;;
;;    This function works for array sizes from 8 to 65528. However, it is recommended 
;; that you use it for values much greater than 8. Depending on your code, using <cpct_memset_f> 
;; for values in the range [8-16] could underperform simple variable assignments. 
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;    AF, BC, DE, HL
;;
;; Required memory:
;;    C-binding   - 46 bytes
;;    ASM-binding - 41 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:

;; (end code)
;;    BC   = *array size* (Number of total bytes to set)
;;    CH   = BC \ 8 (number of *chuncks*, 1 chunck = 8 bytes)
;;    CHHH = CH \ 256 - 1
;;     \ = integer division
