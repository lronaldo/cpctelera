Important:

   Due to recent changes in RGAS, it stopped working under Windows XP. Windows 7 or higher is required to run newer versions. If you still want to use RGAS with your Windows XP, you may want to get an earlier version (1.0 or lower).

   You can get RGAS 1.0 by grabbing all files from this link: https://github.com/lronaldo/cpctelera/tree/97d500e650aac80b738fa936239306a32487e8b7/cpctelera/tools/rgas-1.0
