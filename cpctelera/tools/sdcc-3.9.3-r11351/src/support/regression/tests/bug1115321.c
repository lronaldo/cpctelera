/*
 *  General information about this file:
 *
 *  This file has been created with the ability to be compiled using sdcc
 *  and gcc both.  If gcc is used, the output file can be executed and
 *  the built in test vectors will be run.
 *
 *  The test vectors I created are very simple and in no way test
 *  everything that should be tested or really come close.  The output
 *  is visually inspected for correctness.  Additionally, I have not
 *  done a thorough job testing this to ensure that no buffer overruns
 *  take place.  Logically, everything looks pretty safe, and it works
 *  for the debug generation that I needed it to work for.
 *
 *  I ran into problems when running this on my pic because I was allocating
 *  80 byte long arrays on the stack (which was only 128 bytes is size).
 *  The end result was "it just didn't work" with no real hints.  So if
 *  this happens to you, think about up-ing the stack size or moving your
 *  arrays out of automatic stack variables (defined inside {}s, which
 *  scope the variable) and out to staticly declared memory (aka "global"
 *  variables).
 *
 *  I hope this saves you the day it took me to write and debug.

/*
 *  snprintf is a bound version of the popular sprintf() function.
 *  The purpose of snprintf is to format just like sprintf(), but
 *  to make sure that memory is never accidentally overwritten by
 *  a buffer overrun.
 *
 *  A stripped down version of snprintf for the pic16 platform of the
 *  sdcc project.  Depending on the compile flags set/unset above this
 *  function varies in size from ~16k down to ~5.  Below is the
 *  breakdown:
 *
 *  SUPPORT_CHAR_C  - c  format  - ~0.5k of program space required
 *  SUPPORT_STRING  - s  format  - ~1.6k of program space required
 *
 *  I don't think I have any type of optimization on when I did these
 *  measurements.  They were taken with a snapshot build of sdcc from
 *  January 22, 2005 (end of day).
 *
 *  Supported formatting:
 *  %%, %c, %[ 0][1-9][0-9]*s
 *             \
 *              \-- optional padding value
 *
 *  For more detail on what this formatting means, google 'man printf'
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  char *buffer             -- the buffer to write into (assumed to
 *                              not be NULL)
 *  const unsigned char size -- the maximum number of bytes to write
 *                              into the buffer
 *  const char *format       -- the printf style formatter string (see
 *                              above for supported formats.
 *
 *  Return Values:
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  The actual number of characters written into the buffer.  The count
 *  includes the '\0' located at the end of the string.  If there is
 *  not enough room for the entire string, the '\0' value is written in
 *  as the buffer[end - 1] value.
