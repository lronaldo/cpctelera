			era	format	new	ren	stat	type
Cleaning:		nuke	clean
User interface:		?	bye	cls	echo	exit	force	help
			verbosity	page	prompt	quit	source
Obsolete:		dira	map

~options~
Standard options for several commands:
	* -c  output to console, when default is output to a pager
	* -f  force overwriting of existing files
	* -b  transfer in binary mode
	* -t  transfer in text mode (up to first Ctrl-Z)

The f, b, and t options control the copying process and are available for
	get	mget	put	mput	type	copy
The c option controls the display mode and is available for
	type	dump	stat

See also:
	variables (PAGER)	force	mode

~variables~
Used environment variables:

	PAGER		command to use for paging (default: internal pager)
	TEMP		directory for temporary files (default: current)
	COMSPEC		specifies the standard command processor for DOS

PAGER must point to a program that expects its argument on the commandline, 
and not from stdin, so MORE.COM does not work. V. Buergs's famous LIST does
not work the most time, I don't know why. I recommend LESS.

You can get a listing of all enviroment variables with !SET.
See your DOS manual for further documentation about TEMP and COMSPEC.

~percent~
Percent expansions can be used anywhere in strings. They are replaced by
some runtime dependend values:

	%u  current user area
	%i  filename of image			%I  including full path
	%f  free space in percent		%F  in blocks
	%a  allocated space in percent		%A  in blocks
	%c  current working directory of DOS
	%v  current version			%V  plus compilation info

	%%  the percent sign (%)
	%_  an explicit space
	%#  the hash character (#)
	%e  the escape character
	%q  the quote character (")
	%s  the semicolon character (;)

Some expansions show `#', if there is no image loaded!

Used in commands:
	comment		echo	prompt

~filenames~
DOS filenames: <drive>:<path>\<root>.<extension>
	* and ?, the normal DOS wildcards, are possible in <root> 
	and <extension>.

CP/M filenames: <userarea>:<root>.<extension>
Wildcards:
	*		any sequence of characters
	?		a single character
	[a-z123]	a set of characters
	[^0-9]		a negative set

Note:	* may appear as user number => all users		

Example: Files = {ABC.1, ABC.2, ABC.X, X.ABC, 1:USER.ONE}

	*:*.*		matches all five files
	*.*		matches ABC.1, ABC.2, ABC.X, X.ABC
	*.?		matches ABC.1, ABC.2 ABC.X
	*.[0-9] 	matches ABC.1 ABC.2
	[ab]*.[^0-9]	matches ABC.X
	1:*.*		matches 1:USER.ONE
	1:		sometimes like 1:*.*

~invocation~
Either call CPCfs in interactive mode:

	CPCFS

or in batch mode:

	CPCFS [<image>] <commands>...

where
  <image> is the name of the image on which <commands> should be applied
  <commands> are
	-g 	get	    ≥	-?	usage message
	-mg	mget	    ≥	-f	toggle force
	-p	put	    ≥	-b	binary mode
	-mp	mput	    ≥	-t	text mode
			    ≥	-e	execute next commands
	<none>	dir	    ≥
	-d	dir	    ≥	-nd	Create a new data/system/vortex image.
	-s	stat	    ≥	-ns	The imagename must immediately follow
	-x	source	    ≥	-nv	this switch. (e.g. CPCFS -ND FOO)

Note: Options after -e are considered as options for CPCfs commands!
      Exitcodes are 0 (ok), 1 (error), or 2 (^C pressed)

~about~
CPCXfs - CPCEmu Filesystem Maintenance (Extended) 
based on CPCfs - CPCEmu Filessystem Maintenance, Version 0.85 (Feb. 96)

This version has the same licence as the original. It has been put
together from the sources of CPCfs, and has many bug fixes and enhancements.
I did not see any new releases of CPCfs for a long time, and so I decided
to put this release together. Thankyou to Frederic Herlem for extensive testing,
and compiling a .DEF to be used with this version.

In the original CPCfs license, it states that changed versions should not be distributed.
The aim of this release is not to anger Derik, but to provide other Amstrad users
with a bug-fixed and enhanced version. I like this program, and think it is fantastic,
but I experienced a few bad bugs resulting in corrupted images and incomplete files.
I wanted others to be able to use this fantastic program.

If Derik is reading this message, you are free to use all this code in a new
official release of CPCfs.

This version uses the CPCfs source code, and this is copyright Derik Van ZÅtphen.

Comments on this version should be sent to
	amstrad@aiind.upv.es

The original CPCfs has this license:

This program is Freeware and copyright by Derik van ZÅtphen.
You may distribute the whole package (zip-file), with or without an
appropriate charge. You may not distribute changed versions.

** This software is provided "as-is". No warranties of any kind are made! **

Please send bug reports to
	derik@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

~background~
Record:		the smallest piece of data accessible by CP/M (128 bytes)
Block:		the smallest allocation entity (1024 bytes, vortex: 4096 bytes)
Directory:	the first blocks of the filesystem
Dir.entry:	32 bytes containing the filename and blockpointers
Blockpointer:	one or two bytes pointing to a block of data
Extent:		the amount of blockpointers pointing to 16k of data

~editing~
The following keystrokes are possible while editing a commandline:
	* Curser-Left, -Right
	  Ins, Del, <--
	  Home, End		have the obvious meaning
	* Cursor-Up, -Down	walk thru the history list
	* Ctrl-Home, -End	delete to start/end of line
	* Ctrl-Z		leave CPCfs
	* ESC			delete commandline

The traditonal EMACS contol codes are also possible (^B, ^F, ^V, ^D, ^H,
^A, ^E, ^P, ^N, ^K, ^U).

~bugs~
The following inconsistencies are intentional:

	* weird formats (with interleave or copy protection) are not possible
	* sparse files are not possible	(sometimes created by CP/M programs)
	* wrong setting of environment variables can cause funny errors
	* error messages can be confusing if your DOS disk becomes full
	* your image file must not be readonly

~values~
Numbers:	in C syntax, i.e. decimal, octal with leading "0", 
		hexadecimal with leading "0x".
		Example: USER 15 = USER 017 = USER 0xF

Strings:	Surrounded by `"'
		Example: ECHO "Hello World"

~put~
PUT <options> <dos-filename> [<cpm-filename>]
	Copies a file from DOS to CPC filesystem. If <cpm-filename> is 
	present, <dos-filename> is renamed to that name.
PUT <options> <dos-filename> <userarea>:
	Copies *one* file from DOS to a user area of the CP/M filesystem.
	The colon after <userarea> is important!

See also:
	options		filenames

~get~
GET <options> <cpm-filename> [<dos-filename>]
	Copies a file from CPC to DOS filesystem. If <dos-filename> is 
	present, <cpm-filename> is renamed while copying.
GET <options> <cpm-filename>... <dos-path>
	Copies some files form CPC to a DOS directory. <dos-path> must
	end with a backslash (otherwise GET ONE PATH would be ambigous)

Example:
	GET FOO			copies to .\FOO
	GET FOO DOSFOO		copies to .\DOSFOO
	GET FOO BAR ..\		copies to ..\FOO and ..\BAR

See also:
	options		filenames

~mput~
MPUT <options> <dos-filespec>...
	Same as PUT, but works with wildcards instead of names (m = multiple).
	Renaming on the fly and putting to other user areas is not
	possible here.

See also:
	options		filenames

~mget~
MGET <options> <cpm-filespec>...
	Same as GET, but works with wildcards instead of names (m = multiple)
	Renaming on the fly and getting to other directories is not
	possible here.

See also:
	options		filenames

~open~
OPEN <file>
	Load an image

~close~
CLOSE
	Close the current image

~clean~
CLEAN
	Clean disc image. 

	A disc image that is cleaned will compress better in most cases, 
	compared to the same disc image that has not been cleaned.

	Clean works by nukeing all unused blocks to 0x0e5, and nukeing 
	directory entries for deleted files.

	There is no undo for this operation!

	USE WITH CARE!


~nuke~
NUKE	[-f] <cpm-filespec>
	Nuke a file from the disc.	
	Ask for permission, if a file is R/O. Do not ask if -f is given.

	The directory entries and all data blocks used by the file 
	will be completely nuked to 0x0e5.
	
	Using this command will create a disk image that can compress better
	than the same image with files deleted using DEL/ERA.

	There is no undo for this operation!
	
	USE WITH CARE!

	
	

~new~format~
NEW [-s | -d | -f <format id>] [-e] <imagename>
FORMAT ...
	Build a new empty image file
	If "-e" is specified an Extended "EXTENDED" disk image will be created.
	If "-e" is not specified a standard "MV - CPC" disk image will be created.
	
	The available formats are
	  * -s  SYSTEM		169k net capacity + CP/M tracks
	  * -d  DATA		178k net capacity		(default)
	  * -f  <format id>	Format id from .DEF file

Note: To access formats other than SYSTEM or DATA from a CPC emulator
you may need a ROM or program. (e.g. to access Vortex discs you may need
the VORTEX ROM!)

See also:
	sysgen	stat	dpb
	
~sysgen~
SYSGEN <file>
	Writes the CP/M-System from <file> to current image.

Note: The image must be in system format!

~mode~
MODE <mode>            
	Set transfer mode to either Binary, Text, or Auto.
	  * Binary	the whole file is processed
	  * Text	the file is processed up to the first Ctrl-Z
	  * Auto	Binary or Text processing depends on the analysis
			of the file (>70% printable => Text, otherwise Bin)

See also:
	options

~dir~
DIR <options> <cpm-filespec>
	Print the directory of the current user area.
	<options> are:
	 <none>	(default)	two files per line
	  -w	(wide)		four files per line
	  -l	(long)		including a lot of information
	  -a	(amshead)	including Amsdos Header, if available
	  -u	(unsorted)

The amount of output:
wide    = name, size
default = wide + user, R/O attribute, more-attributes-mark, alloc. entries
long    = default + all attrib., detected mode, alloc. blocks, alloc. records
amshead = default + Amsdos Header

Note: -a, -l, and -w are mutually exclusive!
      Use DIR *:*.* to see all user areas.

See also:
	filenames

~attrib~
ATTRIB <attributes>... <cpm-filespec>...
	Set or reset attributes of files.

Attributes are:
	R/O		readonly			(i.e. R=ON)
	R/W             readwrite			(i.e. R=OFF)
	DIR		appears in directory		(i.e. S=OFF)
	SYS		system file (used for CP/M 3.0)	(i.e. S=ON)
	A		Archive "on" or "off" (used for CP/M 3.0)
	<extended>	there are 8 extended attributes F1..F8, that can
			be either "on" or "off".

Change the R/O, R/W, DIR, and SYS by simply mentioning them with prefixed "-".
Set A and F1..F8 with -A=ON, -F1=OFF, etc.

Note: F5..F8 are officially reserved for CP/M!

Example:
	ATTRIB -R/O -DIR -F1=ON *.C *.H

~era~del~
DEL [-f] <cpm-filespec>...
ERA [-f] <cpm-filespec>...
	Delete files.
	Ask for permission, if a file is R/O. Do not ask if -f is given.

Example:
	DEL *.C *.H	\ Deletes all .C and .H file
	DEL *.[CH]	/
	DEL -f *:*.*	  Deletes the whole image!
	DEL 1: 2:	  Deletes user 1 and 2

~ren~
REN <from-cpm-filespec> <to-cpm-filespec>
REN <from-cpm-filespec>... <userarea>
        Rename a file or shift a set of files to another user area.

Example:
	REN FOO.BAR SENSIBLE.NAM
	REN A.LOT OF FILES.* 1:

~copy~
COPY <options> <from-cpm-filename> <to-cpm-filename>
COPY <options> <cpm-filespec>... <userarea>
	The first form copies a file to a second file.
	The second form copies a set of files to another user area with the 
	same name.

Example:
	COPY FOO.BAR SENSIBLE.NAM
	COPY A.LOT OF FILES.* 1:

See also:
	options

~type~
TYPE <options> <cpm-filename>
	Writes the content of a file to the screen. If in binary mode or

Example:
	TYPE TEXT		assumes detected textmode
	TYPE -B TEXT		force the text to hexdump

See also:
	options

~user~
USER <number>[:]
	Set user area. <number> should be in 0 .. 15.
 	The USER command itself can be left out.

Note: USER 229 does _not_ allow access to deleted files!

Example:
	USER 0			back to default user
	USER 0:			(additional colon possible)
	0:			(shortcut form, colon required)

~force~
FORCE
	Toggle ``Ask on overwrite'' switch.

The ``Overwrite?'' question appears, if you try to overwrite DOS or CP/M
files with PUT, GET, COPY, REN or if you try to DEL a readonly file.

To see the current Force status use STAT.
