v1.11 - March 5th, 2005
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/ This document describes the .ADF file format. An Amiga Disk File is a
sector per sector dump of an Amiga formatted disk. The intent is to
explain in detail how the Amiga stores files and directories on floppy
and hard disks.
A set of C routines (ADFlib) will be supplied to manage the ADF format. /

    1. Introduction

In this document, we will describe how the AmigaDOS is (was?) managing
storage media, from the magnetic layer to the files and directories layer.

With *physical layer*, I'm talking about the way bytes are physically
stored on a magnetic surface, with the RLL or MFM encoding.
The next layer, according to the 'most physical' to 'most conceptual'
order, is the *partitions layer* : this is how the AmigaDOS is managing
media with more then one partition, like Zip disks or hard disks.
The next and last layer is the *volume layer* : where the files and
directories are stored.

The physical layer is described in the 2nd chapter,
The volume layer is the biggest part of the document (4th and 5th
chapters), since it's the most interesting,
The partitions layer is explained in the 6th chapter.

Let's continue with more conventional things in an introduction.

      1.3 Conventions

In this document, hexadecimal values use the C syntax : for example 0x0c
is the decimal value 12.


        Byte ordering

Since the Amiga is a 680x0 based computer, integers that require more
than one byte are stored on disk in 'Motorola order' : the most
significant byte comes first, then the less significant bytes in
descending order of significance (MSB LSB for two-byte integers, B3 B2
B1 B0 for four-byte integers). This is usually called *big endian* byte
ordering.
The Intel based PCs are using the *little endian* byte ordering.


        Vocabulary

A 'word' or 'short' is a 2-byte (16 bits) integer, a 'long' a 4-byte (32
bits) integer. Values are unsigned unless otherwise noted.

A 'block' in this document will be 512 consecutive bytes on disk, unless
noted otherwise, the variable 'BSIZE' will denote the blocksize.
The word 'sector' and 'block' will be used as synonyms here, even if
'sector' is usually related to the physical side, and the 'block' to the
logical side. This is because the AmigaDOS can only handle one sector
per block. Some other Unix filesystems can have more then one sector per
block.

A block pointer is the number of this block on the disk. The first one
is the #0 block.
There are 'logical' and 'physical' block pointers. 'Logical' ones are
related to the start of one volume, 'physical' one are related to the
start of a physical media. If a volume starts at the #0 physical sector,
a physical pointer and a logical pointer is the same thing, like with
floppies.

A simple definition of 'Hashing' could be : "a method to access tables :
given a number or a string, a hash function returns an index into an
array". This definition is correct for this document, but there is a lot
of other hashing methods, that might be far more complex.

Linked lists are cell-oriented data structures. Each cell contains a
pointer to the next or previous cell or both, the last cell pointer is
null.

C example :

struct lcell {
	char name[10];
	/* contains next cell adress, or NULL if this cell is the last */
	struct lcell *next_cell;
	};

Block names begin with a capital (Rootblock). Field names are noted
between quotes ('field_name').

All formats are described as tables, one row per field. Here is an
example with the beginning of the well known GIF format :

offset  type   length  name          comments
----------------------------------------------------------
0       char    3      signature     'GIF'
3       char    3      version       '87a' or '89a'
6       short   1      screen width  (little endian)
8       short   1      screen height (little endian)

The .ADF format is the format created and used by the -incredible- UNIX
Amiga Emulator (UAE), written by Berndt Schmitt. The home page is here :
http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/

The .ADF files can be created with the program *transdisk*.

    2. How are bytes physically read from / written to a disk ?

The following part deals with the way the Amiga disk controller accesses
the magnetic medium. If you only want to understand the .ADF format, you
don't need to read this part.

Information is written on disk with magnetic fields. Magnetic fields can
be made 'on' or 'off'. But the read/write heads are not capable of
detecting directly if a field is on or off. An encoding is used to store
memory bits on the medium. The CHANGE of fields polarisation will
indicate if the bit is 1 or 0. For Amiga floppy disks (and PC floppies),
the encoding scheme is MFM (Modified frequency modulation).


        Notes on the Amiga floppy disk controller :

The Amiga floppy disk controller (FDC) which is called 'Paula' is very
flexible. It is capable of reading/writting
Amiga/PC/Macintosh/AppleII/C64 3.5 inches and 5.25 inches floppy disks.

Paula can read a variable number of bytes from disk, the PC FDC can't.
The PC FDC uses the index hole to find the beginning of a track, Paula
uses a synchronization word. The Macintosh uses GCR encoding instead of MFM.
In fact, Paula is simpler than the PC FDC because it does not perform
automatically the decoding just after the read operation, and the
encoding just before the write operation : it must be done by software.
The MFM decoding/encoding is done by hardware with the PC FDC, the Amiga
can do GCR or MFM decoding/encoding because it's done with the CPU. In
some versions of the AmigaDOS, the decoding/encoding is made by the
Blitter custom chip.

Classic PC FDCs *can't read Amiga floppy disks* even if they are MFM
encoded on a 3.5 inch floppy, because they can not find the beginning of
a track. This is why the .ADF format has been created.

However, a custom FDC available on PC machines is capable of
reading/writing Amiga, PC, Macintosh, Atari and C64 floppies !!! This is
CatWeasel : link <http://www.jschoenfeld.de/products/cwmk3_e.htm>

Paula parametrization for Amiga disks :

    * MFM encoding
    * Precompensation time : 0 nanoseconds
    * Controller clock rate : 2 microseconds per bit cell
    * Synchronization value : 0x4489 

Paula is able to put the read/write heads on a cylinder, and is able to
read with the lower or upper side head. A track of 0x1900 words is
usually read.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.1 What is MFM encoding/decoding ?

The MFM decoding is made by the Amiga CPU, not by Paula. This allows
custom encoding, to protect floppies against copying for example.

Here follows the MFM encoding scheme :

    user's data bit      MFM coded bits
    ---------------      --------------
        1                   01
        0                   10 if following a 0 data bit
        0                   00 if following a 1 data bit

User data long words are split in two parts, a part with even bits part
first, followed by a part with odd bits. Once encoded, the amount of
data stored doubles.
The MFM decoding will transform magnetic fields into computer usuable bits.

The encoding process will take one long (user's data), and produces two
longs (MFM coded longs): one for the even bits of the user long, a
second for the odd bits of the user long.
Vice versa, the decoding process will take the half of two MFM longs to
produce one user's long.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.2 What is the MFM track format ?

Paula will search two synchronization words, and then read 0x1900 words
of data. We will call those 0x1900 words a 'MFM track'.
There are 80 cylinders on a Amiga floppy disk. Each cylinder has 2 MFM
tracks, 1 on each side of the disk.

Double density (DD) disks have 11 sectors per MFM track, High density
(HD) disks have 22 sectors.

So a MFM track consists of 11/22 MFM encoded sectors, plus
inter-track-gap. Note that sectors are not written from #0 to #10/21,
you must use the 'info' field to restore the correct order when you read
the tracks. Each MFM track begins with the first sector, and ends with
the end of the last sector.
Each sector starts with 2 synchronization words. The synchronization
value is 0x4489.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.3 What is the MFM sector format ?

From RKRM: "Per-track Organization: Nulls written as a gap, then 11 or
22 sectors of data. No gaps written between sectors." There are brut
data and encoded data.
Brut data (also called MFM data) doesn't need to be decoded, this is the
synchronization data, the header checksum and data checksum.

The encoded parts are 'header' and 'data'.

Here it comes :

00/0x00	word	2	MFM value 0xAAAA AAAA (when decoded : two bytes of 00 data)

	SYNCHRONIZATION
04/0x04	word	1	MFM value 0x4489 (encoded version of the 0xA1 byte)
06/0x06	word	1	MFM value 0x4489

	HEADER
08/0x08	long	1	info (even bits)
12/0x0c	long	1	info (odd bits)
			decoded long is : 0xFF TT SS SG
				0xFF = Amiga v1.0 format
				TT = track number ( 3 means cylinder 1, head 1)
				SS = sector number ( 0 upto 10/21 )
					sectors are not ordered !!!
				SG = sectors until end of writing (including
					current one)

			Example for cylinder 0, head 1 of a DD disk :
				0xff010009
				0xff010108
				0xff010207
				0xff010306
				0xff010405
				0xff010504
				0xff010603
				0xff010702
				0xff010801
				0xff01090b
				0xff010a0a
                        the order of the track written was sector 9, sector 10,
                         sector 0, sector 1 ...

                        (see also the note below from RKRM)

            Sector Label Area : OS recovery info, reserved for future use

16/0x10	long	4	sector label (even)
32/0x20	long	4	sector label (odd)
                    decoded value is always 0

            This is operating system dependent data and relates to how AmigaDOS
            assigns sectors to files.

            Only available to 'trackdisk.device', but not with any other floppy
            or hard disk device.

	END OF HEADER

48/0x30	long	1	header checksum (even)
52/0x34	long	1	header checksum (odd)
			(computed on mfm longs,
			longs between offsets 8 and 44 
			== 2*(1+4) longs)

56/0x38	long	1	data checksum (even)
60/0x3c	long	1	data checksum (odd)
			(from 64 to 1088 == 2*512 longs)

	DATA
64/0x40	long	512	coded data (even)
576/0x240 long	512	coded data (odd)
1088/0x440
	END OF DATA

Note from RKRM :

The track number and sector number are constant for each particular
sector. However, the sector offset byte changes each time we rewrite
the track.

The Amiga does a full track read starting at a random position on the
track and going for slightly more than a full track read to assure
that all data gets into the buffer. The data buffer is examined to
determine where the first sector of data begins as compared to the
start of the buffer. The track data is block moved to the beginning
of the buffer so as to align some sector with the first location in
the buffer.

Because we start reading at a random spot, the read data may be
divided into three chunks: a series of sectors, the track gap, and
another series of sectors. The sector offset value tells the disk
software how many more sectors remain before the gap. From this the
software can figure out the buffer memory location of the last byte
of legal data in the buffer. It can then search past the gap for the
next sync byte and, having found it, can block move the rest of the
disk data so that all 11 sectors of data are contiguous.

    Example:

        The first-ever write of the track from a buffer looks
        like this:

         |sector0|sector1|sector2|......|sector10|

        sector offset values:

                  11      10      9     .....     1

        (If I find this one at the start of my read buffer, then I
         know there are this many more sectors with no intervening
         gaps before I hit a gap).  Here is a sample read of this
         track:

        |sector9|sector10||sector0|...|sector8|

        value of 'sectors till end of write':

                  2        1     ....    11   ...    3

        result of track re-aligning:

        |sector9|sector10|sector0|...|sector8|

        new sectors till end of write:

                 11       10      9    ...     1

        so that when the track is rewritten, the sector offsets
        are adjusted to match the way the data was written.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4 How to decode MFM data ?

C algorithm :


#define MASK 0x55555555	/* 01010101 ... 01010101 */
unsigned long *p1;	/* MFM coded data buffer (size == 2*data_size) */
unsigned long *q;	/* decoded data buffer (size == data_size) */
unsigned long a,b;
unsigned long chksum;
int data_size;		/* size in long, 1 for header's info, 4 for header's sector label */
int count;

chksum=0L;
/* the decoding is made here long by long : with data_size/4 iterations */
for (count=0; count<data_size/4; count++) {
	a = *p1;                /* longs with even bits */
	b = *(p1+data_size);    /* longs with odd bits : located 'data_size' bytes farther */
	chksum^=a;              /* eor */
	chksum^=b;
        /*
         * MFM decoding, explained on one byte here (x and y will produce t) :
         * the MFM bytes 'abcdefgh' == x and 'ijklmnop' == y will become
         * y & 0x55U = '0j0l0n0p'
         * ( x & 0x55U) << 1 = 'b0d0f0h0'
         * '0j0l0n0p' | 'b0d0f0h0' = 'bjdlfnhp' == t
         */ 
	/* on one long here : */
	*q = ( b & MASK ) | ( ( a & MASK ) << 1 );
	p1++;    /* next 'even bits' long and 'odd bits' long  */
	q++;     /* next location of the future decoded long */
	}
chksum&=MASK;	/* must be 0 after decoding */

For example, to decode the DATA field of a MFM sector :

    * data_size is equal to 512,
    * p1 points to 64 bytes after the beginning of the MFM sector,
    * q points to a 512 unsigned bytes array. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    3. What is the Amiga floppy disk geometry ?

After MFM decoding, you have usuable 'sectors' or 'blocks' into memory.

Here we remind the disk geometries for Double Density disks (DD) and
High Density disks (HD) :

		bytes/sector	sector/track	track/cyl	cyl/disk
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DD disks	512		11		2		80
HD disks 	512		22		2		80

The relations between sectors, sides and cylinders are for a DD disk :

Block	sector	side	cylinder
--------------------------------
0	0	0	0
1	1	0	0
2	2	0	0
...
10	10	0	0
11	0	1	0
...
21	10	1	0
22	0	0	1
..
1759	10	1	79

Order = increasing sectors, then increasing sides, then increasing
cylinders.

A DD disk has 11*2*80=1760 (0 to 1759) blocks, a HD disk has
22*2*80=3520 blocks.

The length of .ADF files for a DD disk is therefore 512*11*2*80 = 901120
bytes.

Those 'raw' blocks, 512 consecutive bytes, store different 'logical'
blocks to manage files and directories.

The classic Amiga filesystem has a internal command with one 32 bits
wide offset parameter (unsigned). It tells where to start the read/write
operation. The biggest size for an Amiga disk is therefore 2^32 = 4 GB.
Anyway, there exists a 3rd party patch which changes the 32 bits limit
to 64 bits (on Aminet, disk/misc/ffstd64.lha).

Jorg Strohmayer added :
TD64 is an unofficial 3rd party hack. Official solution is NSD (new
style device), updates for the internal devices and the filesystem are
available from http://www.amiga.de. There is a patch for old (and TD64)
devices too (NSDPatch).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    4. What is the logical organisation of an Amiga volume ?

A volume is a floppy disk or a hard disk partition.

The first file system for the Amiga was embedded in the version 1.2 of
AmigaDOS.
With version 2.xx of AmigaDOS the Fast File System (FFS) was introduced,
an improved version of the 1.2, also called old file system (OFS).
The version 3.0 of AmigaDOS added an international characters mode
(INTL) and a directory cache mode (DIRC).

Links are only supported under FFS.

The start of a floppy volume contains space for sectors which may
contain boot code.
The middle of the volume contains information about the root (upper
most) directory contents and information about free and used blocks.
Other blocks are of course used to store files and directories.

The file length, the directory tree depth, the number of entries per
directory are only limited by disk size. (Actually the maximum filesize
is limited to 4 Gbyte sizeof(ulong) which should normally be more than
sufficient).

Let's introduce the logical structures used by the Amiga file system in
a table (for floppies) :

Object		Related logical blocks
------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
Volume		Rootblock, Bitmap block
File		File Header block, Extension block, Data block, Link block
Directory	Rootblock, Directory block, Directory Cache block, Link block

The main data types are a trees and linked lists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      4.1 What is a Bootblock ?

Prior to Kickstart 2.0 the bootblock was hardcoded to consist of the
first two sectors of the floppy disks (sector #0 and #1). As of Kick
2.0, booting via the boot-block could be done with any device driver and
the number of blocks could be changed independantly of the number of
reserved blocks by using BOOTBLOCKS in the DOS environment vector
(DosEnvVec).

* BootBlock
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
offset	size    number	name		meaning

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DiskType flag informs of the disk format.

    * OFS = Old/Original File System, the first one. (AmigaDOS 1.2)
    * FFS = Fast File System (AmigaDOS 2.04)
    * INTL = International characters Mode (see section 5.4 <#p54>).
    * DIRC = stands for Directory Cache Mode. This mode speeds up
      directory listing, but uses more disk space (see section 4.7 <#p47>). 

The Old filesystem may have the international and dircache mode enabled.
If the international mode is enabled, the bit #1 is set. If the dircache
is enabled, its flag is set (bit #2), *and the international mode is
also enabled, but the related flag (bit #1) will stay cleared*. The
correct values for flag are therefore : 0 (OFS), 1 (FFS), 2 (OFS/INTL),
3 (FFS/INTL), 4 (OFS/DIRC&INTL), 5 (FFS/DIRC&INTL).

There are few differences between the two file systems :

    * OFS Datablock stores BSIZE-24 bytes (i.e. normally 488 bytes at
      most frequently used BSIZE of 512 bytes), FFS stores BSIZE bytes.
    * FFS supports directory caching, links and international mode,
    * the FFS is faster than OFS. 

If the Bootblock starts with the three characters 'PFS', another
filesystem is used in place of AmigaDOS : the Professional File System.

If the checksum and the DiskType are correct, the system will execute
the bootblock code, at boot time, of course :-).

The Bootblock code is optional, see 5.2 <#p52> section.

The Bootblock checksum algorithm follows :

* in 68000 assembler :

	lea 	bootbuffer,a0
        move.l  a0,a1
        clr.l   4(a1)			;clear the checksum
        move.w  #(BOOTBLOCKSIZE/4)-1,d1	;for floppy disks = 1024
                                        ;for hd = (DosEnvVec->Bootblocks * BSIZE)
        moveq   #0,d0
lpchk:  add.l   (a0)+,d0		;accumulation
        bcc.s   jump                    ;if carry set, add 1 to checksum
        add.l   #1,d0
jump:   dbf     d1,lpchk		;next long word

        not.l   d0
        move.l  d0,4(a1)		;new checksum

#define Short(p) ((p)[0]<<8 | (p)[1])
#define Long(p) (Short(p)<<16 | Short(p+2))

unsigned long newsum,d;

	if ( (ULONG_MAX-newsum) < d )	/* overflow */
		newsum++; 
	newsum+=d; 
}

      4.2 What is a Rootblock ?

The Rootblock is located at the physical middle of the media : block
number 880 for DD disks, block 1760 for HDs. The exact calculation where
it is stored is as follows:

numCyls = highCyl - lowCyl + 1

highKey = numCyls * numSurfaces * numBlocksPerTrack - 1

rootKey = INT (numReserved + highKey) / 2

The Rootblock contains information about the disk : its name, its
formatting date, etc ...

It also contains information to access the files/directories/links
located at the uppermost (root) directory.

The characters '/' and ':' are forbidden in file and volume names, but
*!@#$%|^+&_()=\-[]{}';",<>.? and accented like âè are allowed.

The date fields in the root block (and other blocks) are structured in
the form of DAYS, MINS and TICKS. The DAYS field contains the number of
days since January 1. 1978. MINS is the number of minutes that have
passed since midnight and TICKS are expressed in 1/50s of a second. A
day value of zero is considered illegal by most programs.

The r_date / r_min / r_ticks fields are updated to the last recent
change of the root directory of this volume.

The v_date / v_min / v_ticks fields are updated whenever any change was
made to this volume, not just the root directory.

The c_date / c_min / c_ticks fields contain the date and time when this
volume was initialized (i.e. formatted) and is not changed during its
lifetime.

Some date constraints : 0 <= Mins < 60*24, 0 <= Ticks < 50*60

The Amiga filesystem does not have an inherent year 2000 problem. If you

        4.2.1 How to find the first sector of a directory entry ?

Given the name of a file/directory/link you first have to compute its
hash value with this algorithm :

* The hash function :

#include<ctype.h>

int HashName(unsigned char *name)
{
unsigned long hash, l;				/* sizeof(int)>=2 */
int i;

l=hash=strlen(name);
for(i=0; i<l; i++) {
        hash=hash*13;
        hash=hash + toupper(name[i]);	/* not case sensitive */
        hash=hash & 0x7ff;
        }
hash=hash % ((BSIZE/4)-56);		/* 0 < hash < 71
                                         * in the case of 512 byte blocks */

return(hash);
}

// this code only works with non international mode disks
// see section 5.4 <#p54>

The *toupper()* function is the one thing that distinguishes
international from non-international filesystems. There was a bug in old
AmigaDOS versions for this function applied to international caracters
(ASCII codes > 128). A specific toupper() function (see section 5.4
<#p54>) was then created available with the 'international mode'.

The hash value is then used to access HashTable ('ht' field in
Rootblock/Directory block).

HashTable[ HashValue ] contains the number of the first block of your
object (File header block, Directory block or Link block).

But different names can result in the same HashValue. If more then one
name has the same HashValue, the other blocks (for files and directory
only) are stored in a chained list. This linked list starts at the
'next_hash' field of the File header or Directory block.

For example : 'file_1a', 'file_24' and 'file_5u' have the same hash value.

Here follows the method to find the requested block :

HashValue = HashName( name );
name=uppercase(name);
nsector = Hashtable[ HashValue ];
if (nsector != 0) {
	sector=Load(nsector);		/* reads the 'nsector' sector */
        sector.name = uppercase(sector.name);
        /*
         *  follows the 'same HashValue' chained list if needed
         */
	while ( sector.name != name and sector.Next_hash != 0) {
		sector = Load(nsector);
       	        sector.name = uppercase(sector.name);
	}
	if (sector.name != name)
		puts("File/Dir not found");
}
else
	puts("File/Dir not found");


// this code only works with non international mode disks
// see section 5.4 <#p54>

Figure : HashTable and Directory content

Filenames characters can be lowercase and uppercase, but as shown in the
Hash function, are not case sensitive.

If, for a new entry, the value at hashTable[hashvalue] is different than
0, the new sector pointer will be stored in the last entry of the
same-hashvalue-linked-list. It is necessary to check if the entry name
already exists in this directory. In one word, in the same-hashValue
list, the addition is made at the tail, not the head.
Jorg tells the list is instead sorted by block number.


        4.2.2 How to list all the directory entries ?

Look through the whole HashTable and follow the same 'HashValue' linked
lists if they exist.


        4.2.3 How to compute the checksum ?

#define Short(p) ((p)[0]<<8 | (p)[1])
#define Long(p) (Short(p)<<16 | Short(p+2))

unsigned long newsum;
unsigned char buf[BSIZE];	/* contains rootblock */
int i;

memset(buf+20,0,4);		/* clear old checksum */
newsum=0L;
for(i=0; i<(BSIZE/4); i++)
	newsum+=Long(buf+i*4);
newsum=-newsum;			/* negation */

This checksum algorithm works for most block types except for Bootblock.

The bitmap table ('bm_pages[]') stores one or several pointers to Bitmap
blocks. The first pointer is at index 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      4.3 How are the free and used block lists managed?

Bitmap blocks contain information about free and allocated blocks. One
bit is used per block. If the bit is set, the block is free, a cleared
bit means an allocated block.

Bootblock allocation (2 for floppy, for hard disks the value can be
found at DOSEnvVec->Bootblocks) is not stored in bitmap. Bitmap consists
of longs, each describing the status of 32 blocks, where bit 0
corresponds to the lowest block number.

* Bitmap block (BSIZE bytes), often at rootblock+1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0/0x00	long	1		checksum	normal algorithm
4/0x04	long	(BSIZE/4)-1	map
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here follows for a DD disk the relationship between bitmap and block
number :

block #		long #	bit #
-------------------------------
2		0	0
3		0	1
4		0	2
...
33		0	31
34		1	0
35		1	1
...
880		27	14
881		27	15
...
1759		54	28
1760		54	29

This map is 1758 bits long (1760-2) and is stored on 54 full filled long
and the first 30th bits of the 55th long.

* What is the 'bm_ext' field in Rootblock ?

If 25 bitmap blocks (which pointers are stored in the Rootblock) are not
sufficient (for Hard Disks > ca. 50 Mbyte), the pointers to the further
bitmap blocks are stored in so called bitmap extension blocks. The form
a (surprise, surprise!) linked list, starting at the bm_ext field in the
Rootblock.

* Bitmap extension block (BSIZE bytes) (Hard disk only)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       0/0x00	ulong	(BSIZE/4)-1	bitmap block pointers
BSIZE- 4/0x04	ulong	1		next (0 for last)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bitmap extension linked list start at Rootblock with the 'bm_ext'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      4.4 How are files stored ?

Files are comprised of a file header block, which contains information
about the file (size, last access time, data block pointers, ...) and
the data blocks, which contain the actual data. The file header block
contains up to BSIZE/4-56 data block pointers (which amounts to 72 with
the usual 512 byte blocks).

If a file is larger than that, file extension blocks will be allocated
to hold the data block pointers.

File extension blocks are organised in a linked list, which starts in
File header block ('extension' field).

Figure : Chained lists of the blocks which store files

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with volume names ':' and '/' are forbidden in file names.

The number of blocks used to store a file depends on the filesystem
used, OFS or FFS. If one file has 7 datablocks, the first is at
datablock[71-0], the last at datablocks[71-6], and highseq equals to 7.

For the OFS there are two ways of reading the contents of a file. First
by traversing the linked list of data blocks that is pointed to in
first_data (offset 16) and then following the pointers in each file data
block. The other way of accessing the file data is by using the
data_blocks[] table and going backwards through the data blocks listed
there and then the File extension blocks.

As the FFS doesn't contain extra information in the data blocks (no
pointer list, no checksum) the only way of accessing the file contents
is by going through the data_blocks[] table and the File extension blocks.

An empty file consists of just a File header block, with 'byte_size'
equal to 0, and no Data block pointers in 'data_blocks[]'.

In OFS, there is a second way to read a file : using the Data block
chained list. The list starts in File header ('first_data') and goes on
with 'next_data' in each Data block.

or File extension block is unreadable, there is no way to find the
corresponding Data blocks.

The OFS is more robust than FFS, but slower and can store less data on
disk. As you see, disk salvaging is easier with OFS.

When a file is deleted, only its File header block number is cleared
from the Directory block (or from the same-hash-value list) and the
bitmap is updated. File header block, Data blocks and File extension
blocks are not cleared, but the bitmap blocks are updated. Nevertheless,
the undelete operation is easy, as long as these blocks are not
overwritten.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      4.5 How are directories stored?

Directory blocks are very similar to Rootblock, except they don't need
information about the bitmap and disk, but they allow comments like files.

      4.6 How are links implemented in AmigaDOS ?

With the FFS, links were introduced. Alas, Commodore blundered again:
soft like where terribly broken, so they removed support for them in
AmigaDOS 3.0. Hard links are seen as files, and hard links to
directories are allowed, which opens the way to endless recursion...
In short, the whole implmentation is a mess.
However, some shells (like Csh 5.37) support them, so I'm supplying the
structure.

A 'real' entry is a file or directory entry, opposed to link entries.

A hard link can only be created to the same disk as the real entry disk.
Several links can be made on the same real entry. These are in just
another linked list.
'real entry' always contains the real entry block pointer.
'next_link' stores the links linked list.

New entries are added at the head:

>ls
  ------rw-d     1912  15-May-96 22:28:08  real

Chained list state :

block# real	next	name
----------------------------
484	0	0	real


>ln real link1
>ls
  ------rw-d     1912  15-May-96 22:28:08  real
  -H----rw-d     1912  15-May-96 22:28:10  link1 -> Empty:real

block# real	next	name
----------------------------
484	0	104	real
104	484	0	link1


>ln link1 link2
>ls
  ------rw-d     1912  15-May-96 22:28:08  real
  -H----rw-d     1912  15-May-96 22:28:10  link1 -> Empty:real
  -H----rw-d     1912  15-May-96 22:28:12  link2 -> Empty:real

block# real	next	name
----------------------------
484	0	107	real
104	484	0	link1
107	484	104	link2

The links are stored 'newest first', due to the adding at head.

real -> newest link -> ... -> oldest link -> 0

-> means "points to"

      4.7 How are the blocks associated with the directory cache mode ?

To speed up directory listing, Directory cache blocks have been created.
Directory cache blocks are also organised in chained lists.
The list starts at the directory block (root or normal directory) with
the 'extension' field.

* Directory cache block (BSIZE bytes)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0/0	ulong	1	type		DIRCACHE == 33 (0x21)
4/4	ulong	1	header_key	self pointer
8/8	ulong	1	parent		parent directory
12/c	ulong	1	records_nb	directory entry records in this block
16/10	ulong	1	next_dirc	dir cache chained list
20/14	ulong	1	chksum		normal checksum
24/18	UCHAR	*	records[]	entries list (size = BSIZE-24)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory entries are stored this way :

* Directory cache block entry record (26 <= size (in bytes) <= 77)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	ulong	1	header		entry block pointer
                                        (the link block for a link)
4	ulong	1	size		file size (0 for a directory or a link)
8	ulong	1	protect		protection flags (0 for a link ?)
					 (see file header or directory blocks)
12	ushort	1	UID             user ID
14 	ushort 	1 	GID 		group ID
16	short	1	days		date (always filled)
18	short	1	mins		time (always filled)
20	short	1	ticks
22	char	1	type		secondary type
23	char	1	name_len	1 <= len <= 30 (nl)
24	char	?	name		name
24+nl	char	1	comm_len	0 <= len <= 22 (cl)
25+nl	char	?	comment		comment
25+nl+cl char	1	OPTIONAL padding byte(680x0 longs must be word aligned)

    5. How does a blank disk look like ?

A minimal blank disk has a Bootblock, a Rootblock and a Bitmap block.


      5.1 a Minimal blank floppy disk

20/14	long	1	checksum	computed
312/138	long	1	bm_flag		-1 (valid bitmap)
316/13c	long	1	bm_pages[0]	bitmap sector #
420/1a4	long	1	last access date
424/1a8	long	1	last access time
428/1ac	long	1	last access time
432/1b0	char	1	disk_name size
433/1b1	char	?	disk_name
472/1d8	long	1	last access date
476/1dc	long	1	last access time
480/1e0	long	1	last access time
484/1e4 long    1       creation date
488/1e8 long    1       creation time
492/1ec long    1       creation time
504/1f8	long	1	FFS : first dir cache sector  or 0
508/1fc	long	1	sub_type	1

Unspecified fields are set to 0.


* The Bitmap block (here 881) for a DD disk

0	long	1	checksum
4	long	27	free sectors	0xffffffff
112/70	long	1	root+bitmap	0xffff3fff

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      5.2 A 'Bootable' floppy disk

(*) from Thomas Kessler (tkessler@ra.abo.fi), may 1997 :
This bit tells the shell (which opens its shell-window when booting the
startup-sequence) not to open window unless needed, so a black screen
stays there during boot instead of an empty shell-windows (it's a os2.x
feature).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      5.3 A Directory cache mode floppy disk

* A directory cache block (here 882)

4	long	1	self pointer	882
8	long	1	cached dir	880 (root)
12/c	long	1	entries number	0
16/10	long	1	next dir cache	0 (last)
20/14	long	1	checksum	computed
24	long	122	full of zeros

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      5.4 International Mode

The toupper() function in the HashName() function (3.2.1 paragraph) is
replaced by the following function with the aim of better handling
international characters :

int intl_toupper(int c)
{
   return (c>='a' && c<='z') || (c>=224 && c<=254 && c!=247) ? c - ('a'-'A') : c ;
}

In the Amiga ASCII table, the international character codes are between
192 and 254. Uppercase caracters are between 192 and 222, the lowercase
versions of them are between 224 and 254. The only exception are the
codes 215 and 247, which are respectively the multiply sign and the
divide sign.

The Amiga character set is the same as ISO 8859 Latin-1 character set,
often assumed in HTML pages. This character set is described here :
http://www.w3c.org/

The following structures are mainly extracted from the
'devices/hardblocks.h' and 'dos/filehandler.h' files delivered in
Commodore developer kits.

The hard disk specific structures mainly store the drive geometry, the
written partitions sizes and the filesystem bootcode.

The five kind of blocks are in a reserved area, at the beginning of the
surface. The first of them, Rigid Disk block (RDSK), must be found
within the first 16 blocks of BSIZE lenght. But it can be written inside
the data area, which is dangerous.

        * How to find the physical geometry of the disk ?

A hard disk is made of several physical disks. They have one head for
each writable side. Each physical disk consists of several tracks, which
consist of several sectors. One cylinder is the set of the tracks which
have the same number on each disk.

The total size of the hard disk is expressed in cylinders ('cylinders').
The size of a cylinder is :
the number of heads per cylinder ('heads')
x the number of sectors per track ('sectors')
x the size of a block ('block size').

The 'CylBlocks' field equals to 'heads' x 'sectors'.

The reserved area is often the 2 first cylinders, between the
'RDB_BlockLo' block and the 'RDB_BlockHi' block, included. The
partitionable area, starts at the 'LoCylinder' cylinder until the
'HiCylinder' cylinder, included.

The really last used sector in the reserved area is the sector numbered
'HighRSDKBlock', the first is numbered 0. The SCSI 'hostID' is set to
the id of the SCSI host controller, which is typically 7. Real SCSI
drives ID must be between 0 and 6.

The RDSK block is the "root" of the reserved area. It also contains the
first blocks of three linked lists : one the bad blocks replacement, one
for the partition definitions and one last for the filesystem information.

Some geometry examples :

    * a Zip disk : 2891 cylinders, 1 head, 68 sectors,
    * my 80Mb Seagate IDE harddisk : 980 cylinders, 10 heads, 17 sectors.
    * a 500 Mbyte Fujitsu 2624SA: 1472 cylinders, 11 heads, 63 sectors
    * a 50 Mbyte Quantum LPS52: 2085 cylinders, 1 head, 49 sectors 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There exists one 'PART' block per partition.

The block pointers in the reserved area are relative to the beginning of
the media. The block pointers in a partition are relative to the first
block of the partition.

The Rootblock of a partition is normally located in the middle of an
AmigaDOS filesystem. Please see 4.2 What is a Rootblock? <#p42> for the
exact calculation of it's location.

The first two blocks of a partition contain a Bootblock. You have to use
it to determine the correct file system, and if the international or
dircache modes are used. Don't rely only on the PART and FSHD 'DosType'
field.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      6.4 What are FSHD blocks ?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This block contains the code of the filesystem. It isn't needed to reach

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    7. The Hard file : a big floppy dump file

A hardfile is a file which contains an Amiga volume.

It is created with WinUAE (http://www.winuae.net/), and not the Amiga
and the AmigaDOS. WinUAE is able to produce an empty file with random
contents of a choosen size, often several megabytes long.
Under WinUAE, a AmigaDOS device appears, associated with the
uaehf.device (UAE hardfile). You have to format it with the Workbench,
and you obtain an 'hardfile'. This volume is then usable inside the
emulator by AmigaDOS (it should also be mountable under Linux with the
AFFS filesystem).

For example a 8Mb hardfile could be mounted on a kickstart 1.3 Amiga
with the following mountlist (from uae docs/README) :

UAE0:  Device = uaehf.device
	   Unit   = 0
	   Flags  = 0
	   Surfaces  = 1
	   BlocksPerTrack = 32
	   Reserved = 1
	   Interleave = 0
	   LowCyl = 0  ;  HighCyl = 511
	   Buffers = 5
	   DosType = 0x444F5300
	   BufMemType = 1

An hardfile is like a floppy disk dump, but bigger : it has a bootblock,
a rootblock, a bitmap and perhaps dircache blocks.
The first three bytes of a hardfile is then 'D' 'O' 'S'.

The geometry is : heads = 1, sectors = 32, 'cylinders' depends the
hardfile size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    8. Advanced information


        Bitmap related

* Bitmap allocation starts at root block, upto highest block. The next
allocated blocks are located just after boot blocks and finally the last
allocated block is the sector before root block.

root -> max -> boot+1 -> root-1

-> means "followed on disk by"

If you free some blocks by deleting a file, for example, the first next
used block will be the first free block encountered starting from the
Rootblock. The just freed blocks will be reused. It means that when you
delete a file and you want to recover it, don't write anything else to
the disk.
This strategy must have been chosen to minimize fragmentation.


        Files related

* The order in which data and file extension blocks for a given file are
written on disk differs with OFS and FFS.

    * OFS & FFS : All the data blocks of the file header block are
      written first.
    * FFS : Then follow all the file extension blocks of the file, then
      all the remaining data blocks are written.
      OFS : Each file extension block is followed by the related data
      blocks. So the last extension block is followed by the remaining
      data blocks.


OFS:
header -> data blocks -> ext. block -> data blocks -> ext. block -> data
blocks

FFS:
header -> data blocks -> all ext. block -> all remaining data blocks

-> means "followed on disk by"

This difference is probably the main reason why FFS is faster then OFS.

Under FFS, the hash chains are sorted by block number.

        How to rename an entry ?

   1. Compute the new hashvalue
   2. Move the first sector pointer from the old hashvalue index to the
      new one
   3. Change the name in the directory or file header block

    10. C routines : the ADF library

The ADFlib is a portable C library designed to manage Amiga formatted
devices like harddisks and ZIP disks, or dump files of this kind of
media via the .ADF format.

The API permits you to :

    * mount/unmount a device (real one or a dump file),
    * mount/unmount a volume (partition),
    * create/open/close/delete/move/undelete a file,
    * read/write bytes from/to a file,
    * create/delete/undelete a directory,
    * get directory contents, change current directory, get parent
      directory. 

A callback system makes it easy to write a real device driver for any
platform. The *ADFOpus* ( http://adfopus.sourceforge.net/) application
(a useful Windows Explorer like for ADF files and devices), written by
Dan Sutherlan is able to access from NT4 an 2.5 inches harddisk
formatted under AmigaDOS.
The *ADFView* Windows Explorer shell extension
(http://www.viksoe.dk/code/adfview.htm) written by Bjarke Viksoe is also
using ADFlib. Hard-disks under W2000 are also supported.

See the 1.2 section <#p12> to see how to obtain the package.
