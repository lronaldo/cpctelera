ADFLib changes - Wednesday 16/10/02
-----------------------------------

Background
----------
Bjark Viksoe changed ADFLib 0.7.9b in or before December 2001. Experimental
version sent to me by Laurent in December 2001, soon to be released as 0.7.9c.
Changes tried with ADFOpus then put aside due to difficulties compiling.
Successfully tried again in October 2002, having neither heard anything more
from Laurent nor seen a later version at the web site.

Bjark Viksoe's changes removed the dynamic projects and changed a number of
parameters such as where compiled files were stored. These were potentially not
portable  and operated outside the compilation directory e.g. "..\..\AdfLib...",
"C:\Temp". 

Laurent's original settings were slightly at odds with common VC++ practice i.e. Win32
and Debug directories used for compiled files rather than Release and Debug; Debug
executables used Release libs rather than debug versions.

Enter Gary with a shiny version of ADF Opus to release and a desire to release it with
a clean and equally shiny ADFLib 0.7.9c distribution.


Method
------
I started with a clean installation of ADFLib 0.7.9b. Loading this into VC++ 6 SP5
updated the project and workspace files to VC++ 6 versions. Next, I unpacked a clean
installation of the potential 0.7.9c version received from Laurent. I then used WinDiff
to determine exactly what changes Bjark had made and manually edited the 0.7.9b files
to match.


Changes
-------

-Reinstated dynlib, dynunadf and staticunadf by starting with V0.7.9b.

-Returned to original ADFLib compilation settings as above, then made some subtle changes.

-Release output files now go to Bin/Win32/Release, rather than Bin/Win32, for
 symmetry and standardisation. Intermediate files still go to Release and Debug.

-Debug dynunadf and staticunadf now use the debug libs, not the release ones,
 to allow full debugger access.

-Fixed a path setting problem which caused a failure to find adflibd.lib.

-Changed Bjark's setting of "C7 Compatible" back to "Program Database for Edit and Continue"
 for consistency with the other projects.

-Annotated Bjark's changes with /* BV */ for easy identification.

-Removed C++ comment tags and replaced them with C tags across the board. ADFLib should
 hopefully be pure C again now.

-Removed a change implemented for Opus which was inadvertantly left in during earlier updates
 i.e. a string added to struct nativeDevice in adf_nativ.h.

-Updated Laurent's copyright on every page to include 2002.

-Updated the version and date strings to:
 #define ADFLIB_VERSION "0.7.9c"
 #define ADFLIB_DATE "16 October, 2002"

-Everything compiles cleanly with no warnings. :-)

-Bjark's changes appear to support non-standard FD ADFs up to 83 tracks. Can we confirm this?
