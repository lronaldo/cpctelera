README for the SDCC/pic14 library

Building the library
====================
1. Edit ./Makefile.in and update the ARCH variable to match your
   device. It should be safe to keep the default setting (p18f877),
   but performance improvements might be possible in specifying the
   actual target chip there.
   
2. Run './configure'

3. Run 'make clean'

4. Run 'make all'

Prerequisites
=============
* a recently new GNU Make (tested with 3.80)
* current gputils (tested with 0.13.2)
* SDCC with enabled 14 bit PIC backend (tested with 2.5.4)
