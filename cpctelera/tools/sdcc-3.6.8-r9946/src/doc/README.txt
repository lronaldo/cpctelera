SDCC - free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler
------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to SDCC, free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C
compiler suite that targets a growing list of processors including the
Intel MCS51 based microprocessors (8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.), Maxim
(formerly Dallas) DS80C390 variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08
based (hc08, s08), Zilog Z80 based MCUs (z80, z180, gbz80, Rabbit
2000/3000, Rabbit 3000A) and STMicroelectronics STM8. Work is in progress
on supporting the Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 targets. It can be retargeted
for other microprocessors.

See share/sdcc/doc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/sdcc/doc directory for more documentation.

See http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ for the latest information on sdcc.


Licenses:
~~~~~~~~~
SDCC compiler suite is a collection of several components derived from
different sources with different FOSS licenses. See the sdccman.pdf
document, chapter "SDCC Suite Licenses" for details.

The code or object files generated by SDCC suite are not licensed, so
they can be used in FLOSS or proprietary (closed source) applications.

The great majority of sdcc run-time libraries are licensed under the
GPLv2+LE which allows linking of sdcc run time libraries with
proprietary (closed source) applications.

Exception are pic device libraries and header files which are derived
from Microchip header (.inc) and linker script (.lkr) files. Microchip
requires that "The header files should state that they are only to be
used with authentic Microchip devices" which makes them incompatible
with the GPL. Pic device libraries and header files are located at
non-free/lib and non-free/include directories respectively. Sdcc should
be run with the --use-non-free command line option in order to include
non-free header files and libraries.

Support:
~~~~~~~~
SDCC compiler suite is a collaborative effort between a group of
volunteers. Please feel free to report bugs via the Sourceforge bug
tracker, or to ask questions on the user mailing list. See:

Notes:
* The ds400, pic14 and pic16 are currently experimental, but work is in
progress. Please check http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snap.php for snapshots.
* The TININative, avr and xa51 targets are no longer maintained.
