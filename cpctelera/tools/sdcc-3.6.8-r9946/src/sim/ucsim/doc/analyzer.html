    <h1>Code analyser</h1>
    Code
    analyser analyses the code of the simulated program and tries to
    figure out which address contains valid instruction. <br>
    <br>
    Analyser starts
    analysing of the code with address 0 which always must contain an
    instruction because reset of the device sets zero into program
    counter. So, analyser marks address 0 that it contains an
    instruction. Then it marks the address of the next instruction and so
    on. If the analyser finds a <i>jump</i> instruction it continues with
    destination address of the <i>jump</i> instruction. If it finds a
    <i>call</i> instruction, it recursively analyses destination address
    as well as next instruction follows the <i>call</i> one.<br>
    <br>
    Analysator
    stops if it finds an address which is already marked or if it finds a
    <i>return</i> instruction or an indirect <i>jump</i> which is
    impossible to follow. All these mean that it is impossible to discover
    all instructions of the program.
    <p>This problem is solved in very simple way. If the
      execution reaches an unmarked address, the analyser is called to
      analyse the code starting at actual address pointed by the PC.</p>
