    <h1>Starting the simulator</h1>
    There are separate programs to simulate different microcontroller families:
    <p>MCS51 family is simulated by <b>s51</b> <br>
      AVR family is simulated by <b>savr</b> <br>
      Z80 processor is simulated by <b>sz80</b> <br>
      XA family is simulated by <b>sxa</b> <br>
      HC08 processor is simulated by <b>shc08</b> <br>
      ST7 family is simulated by <b>sst7</b> <br>
      STM8 family is simulated by <b>sstm8</b> <br>
      TLCS90 family is simulated by <b>stlcs</b> </p>
    <p>The simulator can be started in the following way: </p>
    <p><tt><font color="blue">$</font> s51 [-hHVvPg] [-p prompt] [-t CPU] [-X
        freq[k|M]] [-C cfg_file] [-c file] [-s file] [-S optionlist] [-a nr] [-Z
        portnum] [-k portnum] [files...]</tt> </p>
    <p>Specified files must be names of Intel hex files. Simulator loads them in
      the specified order into the ROM of the simulated system. </p>
    <p>Options: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt><b>-t CPU</b></tt> </dt>
      <dd>Type of CPU. Recognized types are different for different simulators,
        for example MCS51 simulator recognizes 51, 8051, 8751, C51, 80C51,
        87C51, 31, 8031, C31, 80C31, 52, 8052, 8752, C52, 80C52, 87C52, 32,
        8032, C32, 80C32, 51R, 51RA, 51RB, 51RC, C51R, C51RA, C51RB, C51RC,
        89C51R, 251, C251, DS390, DS390F. Note that recognition of a CPU type as
        option does not mean that the simulator can simulate that kind of CPU.
        Default type is C51. <br>
        DS390 supports Dallas DS80C390 24 bit flat mode, dual-dptr operations,
        etc. DS390F is the same as DS390, but it starts already in 24 bit flat
        mode (ACON = 0xFA instead of 0xF8). DS390F is needed to run programs
        compiled with sdcc -mds390.<br>
        -H option can be used to list all of recognized CPU types.<br>
        See <a href="cpu_types.html">how to select CPU type</a>. </dd>
      <dt><tt><b>-X freq[k|M]</b></tt> </dt>
      <dd>XTAL frequency is <b>freq</b> Hertz. <b>k</b> or <b>M</b> can be
        used to specify frequency in kHZ or MHz. Space is not allowed between
        the number and the <b>k</b> or <b>M</b>. Default value is 11059200 Hz.
        <a name="coption"></a></dd>
      <dt><a name="coption"><tt><b>-c file</b></tt></a> </dt>
      <dd>Open command console on <b>file</b>. Command consoles are on standard
        input and output by default. Using this option the console can be opened
        on any file for example on the serial interface of the computer. <a name="Zoption"></a></dd>
      <dt><a name="Zoption"><tt><b>-Z portnum</b></tt></a> </dt>
      <dd>Listen for incoming connections on port <b>portnum</b>. Using this
        option <i>&#181;Csim</i> can serve multiple consoles. You can get a console
        by simply telnet into machine running <i>&#181;Csim</i> to port <b>portnumber</b>.
        This option is not available on platforms which doesn't support BSD
        networking. <br>
        See <a href="mulcons.html">how to use multiple consoles</a>. </dd>
      <dt><tt><b>-k portnum</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Listen for incoming connections on port <b>portnum</b>. When this
        port connected, the connection will be attached to simulated UART0.This
        option is not useful for other UARTs, so it is better to use the more
        general -S option. </dd>
      <dt><tt><b>-s file</b></tt> </dt>
      <dd>Connect serial interface (UART0) of the simulated microcontroller to
        the <b>file</b>. Nothing is used by default which means that characters
        transmitted by serial interface of the simulated microcontroller go to
        nowhere and it will never receive anything. If you are going to
        communicate with serial interface interactively the best idea is to
        specify a terminal with -s option. </dd>
      <dt><tt><b>-S uart=nr,in=file,out=file,port=nr</b></tt> </dt>
      <dd>Using this option you can specify different files for input and output
        streams that <i>&#181;Csim</i> uses to simulate microprocessor's serial
        interface. <br>
        See <a href="serial.html">more about serial interface simulation</a>. </dd>
      <dt><tt><b>-p prompt</b></tt> </dt>
      <dd>Using this option you can specify any string to be the prompt of
        command interpreter, for example:
        <pre><font color="blue">$</font> s51 -p "s51&gt; "
