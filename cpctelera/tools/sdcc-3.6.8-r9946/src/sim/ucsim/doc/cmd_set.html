    <h2>Set commands</h2>
    Set commands can be used to set value of memory cells, bits, or port
    pins. Those commands that set value of memory interpret their command
    lines a little bit different than other commands. First parameter is
    always the start address of the memory area which is being set. This
    parameter is followed by a list of data parameters. Data can be
    specified by a number. Numbers must begin with a digit. Each number
    specifies one byte of data. If the parameter begins with a non-digit
    character, it is interpreted as string of characters and this kind of
    parameter specifies as many bytes as many characters the string
    has. Strings can contain escape sequencies (see description of <a href="cmd_general.html#wi"><b>wi</b></a>
    command where escape
    sequencies are discussed) but they can not contain spaces because
    space characters (space, tabulator and vertical tabulator) separates
    parameters. Spaces can be specified as escape sequences or separated
    number parameters if needed. Only space characters separate data
    parameters while normally comma (<tt>,</tt>) and semicolon (<tt>;</tt>)
    are interpreted as separator characters too.
