    <h1>Using multiple consoles</h1>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    Using more than one console can be useful if you want to issue a
    command during the simulated program is executed.
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>To get multiple consoles you have to execute the simulator in the
      <i>background</i> like daemons run in UNIX systems. The simulator
      then will listen and wait for network connection requests and provide
      console functions for network connections.
    </p>
    <p>To run <i>&#181;Csim</i> in the background you have to use <a href="invoke.html#Zoption">-Z</a>
      option for the simulator:
    </p>
    <pre><font color="blue">pigmy$</font> s51 -Z 5555 foo.hex
</pre>
    In this case s51 runs in foreground in your command interpreters point
    of view. Of course you can run the program really in the background:
    <pre><font color="blue">pigmy$</font> s51 -Z 5555 foo.hex &amp;
</pre>
    The parameter of the <a href="invoke.html#Zoption">-Z</a> option is a
    port number. This can be number of any unused port of your machine. If
    the specified port is already occupied then following message appears:
    <pre><font color="blue">pigmy$</font> s51 -Z 5555
<font color="red">bind: Address already in use</font>
</pre>
    In this case you have to use an other number.
    <p>Let's suppose you have found a free port number and the simulator
      listens on it. Now go to somewhere else, at least to an other window
      and connect to the simulator:
    </p>
    <pre><font color="blue">other_machine$</font> telnet pigmy 5555
</pre>
    First parameter to the telnet command is the name of the machine where
    the simulator is running on. It can be <tt>localhost</tt> if you are
    on the same machine or the fully qualified host name if you are at the
    other end of the world. Second parameter is the number of the port
    where the simulator is listening. It must be the same number which was
    specified as parameter of the <a href="invoke.html#Zoption">-Z</a>
    option when the simulator was started (see above).
    <p>Connecting to the simulator you get a command console:
    </p>
    <pre><font color="blue">pigmy$</font> telnet pigmy 5555
<font color="green">Trying 127.0.0.1...

    <h3>What to do with it?</h3>
    Obviously you can telnet into the simulator as many times as many
    command consoles you want. You can start the execution using one
    console and while the program is executed you can, for example, modify
    ports on the other console.
    <h3>Stop</h3>
    Using <a href="cmd.html#q">quit (q)</a> command you can not stop the
    simulator. It just stops the actual console and the simulator
    continues to listen for incoming network connections.
    <p>To stop the simulator completely you have to use <a href="cmd.html#kill">kill</a>
      command. Note that if you stop the
      simulator then all the active network connections (all other consoles)
      will stop.
    </p>
    <h3>Tricks</h3>
    You can get a console on the terminal where you started the
    simulator. To do this you must explicitly ask the simulator to open a
    console on the standard input/output. You can do this using <a href="invoke.html#coption">-c</a>
    option and specify the actual
    terminal as parameter for it:
    <pre><font color="blue">pigmy$</font> s51 -Z 5555 foo.hex -c /dev/tty
</pre>
