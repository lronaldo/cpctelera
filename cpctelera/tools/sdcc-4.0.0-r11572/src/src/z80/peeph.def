// peeph.def - Common Z80 and gbz80 peephole rules

// This file should contain common Z80/GBZ80 peepholes.
// However the GBZ80 port is currently unmaintained;
// a GBZ80 expert could extract peepholes that are useful for both Z80 and GBZ80
// from peeph-z80.def and peeph-gbz80.def and move them here.
