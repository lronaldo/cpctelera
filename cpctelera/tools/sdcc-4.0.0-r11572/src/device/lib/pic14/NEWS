To accomodate for devices with enhanced cores, there are now
two variants of libm and libsdcc:
Applications targetting regular, non-enhanced devices should
link with libm.lib and libsdcc.lib (no change).
Applications that target enhaned devices should link with
libme.lib and libsdcce.lib instead. When the linker is
invoked via sdcc, the proper libsdcc{,e}.lib will be chosen
automatically -- no such mechanism has been established for
libm{,e}.lib!

The build system has also been converted to an Automake-based
one and libdev/ has been moved completely to the non-free
subtree.

Added device specific SFR definitions in libdev/.
From now on all projects should be linked not only with
libsdcc.lib but also with pic$(ARCH).lib where ARCH is
something like p16f877.

Generic pointer support routines and additional arithmetic halpers
have been added to the library.

Although the compiled library should be portable across (all?)
pic14 devices, I recommend selecting the desired target chip
by setting the ARCH variable to the desired target chip in
  - Makefile.common	(AFTER having run ./configure)  OR
  - Makefile.common.in	(BEFORE running ./configure)
in order to maximize performance (smaller devices ignore
BANKSEL directives, i.e. updates to the IRP bit).

The pic14 library is split into several parts:

* common part
  The common part reuses the (hardware independant) sources found 
  under device/lib/ (currently not used).
* pic14 specific part
  The pic14 specific library routines are found in subdirectories of
  device/lib/pic/ and provide specialized implementations better
  suited for the pic14 architecture and additional functions not
  found in (or not reused from) the common sources.
* device specific part
  This part is planned to support specific I/O sub-devices not
  common to all pic14 chips. This part is currently absent...

The SDCC/pic14 library has been created by
	Raphael Neider <rneider AT web.de> (2005)

It is currently maintained by
	Raphael Neider <rneider AT web.de>

The pic14 and the device specific parts (whose sources are found
in device/lib/pic/) are to be licensed nuder the terms of the

The sources from the common part are licensed as indicated in each

Requests for enhancements, additions or modifications should be posted
at the SDCC user's or developer's mailing list or directly be sent to
the current maintainer of the library as indicated above.
