SDCC Binary Kit Install Help
----------------------------

For Linux users:
================
To install:

* Extract the binary kit to a temporary directory.
  This will create a new directory called 'sdcc-4.0.0' in the temporary directory.
    cd ~
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    tar xjf path/to/binary/kit/sdcc-4.0.0-i386-unknown-linux2.5.tar.bz2

* Change to the sdcc directory and copy all files to /usr/local
    cd sdcc-4.0.0
    cp -r * /usr/local

This will install sdcc binaries into: /usr/local/bin/
header files into:                    /usr/local/share/sdcc/include/
non-free header files into:           /usr/local/share/sdcc/non-free/include/
library files into:                   /usr/local/share/sdcc/lib/
non-free library files into:          /usr/local/share/sdcc/non-free/lib/
and documentation into:               /usr/local/share/sdcc/doc/

You can test the install by entering:
    /usr/local/bin/sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.

Even if the default search paths look into /usr/local, sdcc is fully
relocatable. Try `sdcc --print-search-dirs` if you have problems with header
or library files. See sdccman.pdf for more detailed information.


For Windows 9X/NT/2000/XP/Vista/7/8 users:
==========================================
To install:

* If you would like to keep a copy of your previous version,
  rename the directory where it's installed first
* Run sdcc-4.0.0-setup.exe for 32 bit Windows or
  Run sdcc-4.0.0-x64-setup.exe for 64 bit Windows

By default this will install sdcc binaries into: C:\Program Files\SDCC\bin\
header files into:                               C:\Program Files\SDCC\include\
non-free header files into:                      C:\Program Files\SDCC\non-free\include\
library files into:                              C:\Program Files\SDCC\lib\
non-free library files into:                     C:\Program Files\SDCC\non-free\lib\
and documentation into:                          C:\Program Files\SDCC\doc\

You can test the install by opening a DOS box and entering:
    sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.

sdcc for windows is fully relocatable. Try `sdcc --print-search-dirs` if you
have problems with header or library files. See sdccman.pdf for more
detailed information.


For Mac OS X users:
===================
To install:

* Extract the binary kit to a temporary directory.
  This will create a new directory called 'sdcc-4.0.0' in the temporary directory.
    cd ~
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    tar xjf path/to/binary/kit/sdcc-4.0.0-universal-apple-macosx.tar.bz2

* Change to the sdcc directory and copy all files to /Developer/sdcc
    cp -r sdcc /Developer/sdcc

This will install sdcc binaries into: /Developer/sdcc/bin/
header files into:                    /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/include/
non-free header files into:           /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/non-free/include/
library files into:                   /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/lib/
non-free library files into:          /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/non-free/lib/
and documentation into:               /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/doc/

You can test the install by entering:
    /Developer/sdcc/bin/sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.

Even if the default search paths look into /usr/local, sdcc is fully
relocatable. Try `sdcc --print-search-dirs` if you have problems with header
or library files. See sdccman.pdf for more detailed information.
