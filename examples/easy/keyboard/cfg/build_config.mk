## you would like to build this example of use of the CPCtelera Engine.  ##
## Below you will find several configuration sections with the macros    ##
## available to configure the build, along with explanation comments to  ##
## help you understand what they do. Please, change everything you want. ##

## CPCTELERA MAIN PATH
##   Sets CPCTelera main path for accessing tools and configuration. If you
##   change folder structure, change CPCT_PATH value for its absolute path.

## SECTION 1: Project configuration 
##
## This section establishes source and object subfolders and the binary objects to
## be built. Normally, you want to change the OBJ files you want to be built, selecting
## only the ones that contain the actual code that will be used by you in your application.
#####

# Name of the project (without spaces, as it will be used as filename)
#   and Z80 memory location where code will start in the generated binary
PROJNAME   := keyboard
Z80CODELOC := 0x0100

# Folders 
SRCDIR  := src
OBJDIR  := obj

# File extensions
C_EXT   := c
ASM_EXT := s
OBJ_EXT := rel

# BINARY CONFIG
BINFILE := $(OBJDIR)/$(PROJNAME).bin

## SECTION 2: TOOL PATH CONFIGURATION
##
## Paths are configured in the global_paths.mk configuration file included 
## here. You may overwrite the values of path variables after the include 
## if you wanted specific configuration for this project.
####

## SECTION 3: COMPILATION CONFIGURATION
##
##   Flags used to configure the compilation of your code. They are usually 
##   fine for most of the projects, but you may change them for special uses.

## SECTION 4: CALCULATED FOLDERS, SUBFOLDERS AND FILES
##
##  These macros calculate code subfolders, get all the source files and generate
##  the corresponding subfolders and files in the object directory. All subfolders
##  and files with source extension found are added, up to 1 level of depth in
##  folder structure inside the main source directory.
